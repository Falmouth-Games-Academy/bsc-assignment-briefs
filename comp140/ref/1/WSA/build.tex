\section*{Introduction}

In this worksheet, you will implement a version of the ``terminal hacking'' minigame from \emph{Fallout~4} (Bethesda, 2015); see Figure~\ref{fig:fallout_terminal}.
In this minigame you must guess a secret $n$-letter word, one of several options presented to you.
On choosing an option, you are told the \emph{likeness}: the number of letters which match the secret word (i.e.\ the same letter in the same position).
For example if the secret word is \texttt{HOUSE} and your guess is \texttt{MOUSE}, the likeness is $4$ out of $5$.
If your guess is \texttt{HOPES}, the likeness is $2$ out of $5$ (the letters \texttt{S} and \texttt{E} do not count as they are in the wrong positions).

The GitHub repository contains a project named \texttt{PartA\_TerminalHacking} for you to build upon.
This contains code to read words from a file, and choose the secret word and other words.
You will implement the rest of the game.

\section{} \label{core-a-first}

Algorithm~\ref{alg:a_likeness} takes a guessed word and the secret word, and returns the likeness score as described above.

\textbf{Implement} the algorithm as a C++ function in \texttt{main.cpp}, choosing appropriate data types for the parameters, return value, and any variables.

\begin{algorithm}[t]
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\Procedure{GetLikeness}{guessedWord, secretWord}
		\State $\text{result} \gets 0$
		\For{$i = 0, 1, \dots, \text{secretWord.length} - 1$}
		\If{$\text{secretWord}[i] = \text{guessedWord}[i]$}
		\State increment result
		\EndIf
		\EndFor
		\State \textbf{return} result
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
	\caption{An algorithm for calculating the likeness score for the terminal hacking minigame.}
	\label{alg:a_likeness}
\end{algorithm}

\section{} \label{core-a-last}

\textbf{Implement} the main loop of the game, structured
according to the flowchart shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flowchart_a}.

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1.5cm]
		\node (start) [startstop] {Start};
		\node (choosewords) [process, below of=start] {Choose secret word and other words};
		\node (displaywords) [io, below of=choosewords] {Display all words};
		\node (initlives) [process, below of=displaywords] {Set lives $= 4$};
		\node (enterguess) [io, below of=initlives] {Enter guess};

		\node (isdead) [decision, below of=loselife, yshift=-0.5cm] {Is lives $\leq 0$?};
		\node (youlose) [io, below of=isdead, yshift=-0.5cm] {Print ``You lose!''};

		\coordinate[left of=isdead, xshift=-0.5cm] (tmp1);
		\draw [arrow] (isdead) -- node[anchor=north] {no} (tmp1) |- (enterguess);

\section{Stretch goal} \label{stretch-a}

In the skeleton project, the words are chosen at random.
This may lead to instances of the game which are unsatisfying, for example where all words
have a low likeness score with respect to the secret word.

\textbf{Design} an improved word choosing algorithm.
Present your algorithm as pseudocode and/or a flowchart in your \texttt{readme.md} file on GitHub.

\textbf{Implement} your algorithm within your C++ project.
