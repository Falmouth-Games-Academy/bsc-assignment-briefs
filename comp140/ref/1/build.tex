		``As soon as we started programming, we found out to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.''

	In this referral assignment, you are required to \textbf{complete} the worksheets from the original assignment 1, based on the feedback given in Pull Requests.
	
	In order for programmers to communicate with each other regarding the technical aspects of a game development project, they must have good computational thinking skills, a strong foundational knowledge of computing principles, applied knowledge of program design notations and annotations, and a working knowledge of particular programming constructs (often as a result of writing their own versions). Such knowledge and skills take time and a sustained effort to develop.
	
	This assignment is formed of several parts, \textbf{three} parts corresponding to a worksheet, addressing the following learning objectives:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
		\item \textbf{Apply} the basic principles of programming in C++;
		\item \textbf{Implement} algorithms in C++ and SDL2 using notations such as flowcharts and pseudocode;
		\item \textbf{Apply} theoretical concepts such as communication protocols and object-orientated design patterns.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	For each worksheet you must:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item \textbf{Read} the instructions in the worksheet;
		\item \textbf{Complete} all of the problems presented in the worksheet;
		\item \textbf{Make} the solution available to the module leader for formative review;
		\item and \textbf{submit} the solution summatively on the LearningSpace.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection*{Assignment Setup}
	
	This assignment consists of one followed \textbf{single summative submission}.
	
	Prepare a \textbf{single \texttt{.zip} file} containing your five worksheet submissions \textbf{in separate folders}, and upload it to the appropriate submission area on LearningSpace.
	
	This final submission is subject to the usual university policies regarding late submission or non-submission---even if you have met all the formative deadlines for individual worksheets, failure to make a submission via LearningSpace by the summative deadline will be subject to late submission penalties.
	
	\section*{Additional Guidance}
	
	Make a submission on time and you will get a basic pass on that worksheet, even if your solution is incorrect or incomplete.
	A solution meeting all of the correctness and/or functionality criteria on the worksheet is required to demonstrate basic proficiency,
	with higher grades contingent on your solution being of a high quality.
	The individual worksheets give more guidance as to what constitutes ``quality'' for that particular exercise,
	but bear in mind that a major purpose of these worksheets is to assess your ability to communicate
	complex computational ideas in English, in notation and in program code.
	Thus pay particular attention to the precision and clarity of your written communication,
	and the readability and maintainability of your source code.
	
	The underlying skills being developed are also critically important to your progression as a programmer, so do not neglect the work.
	Do not underestimate the time it takes to complete tasks that may appear trivial when you first see them.
	Do not leave work until the last minute! With programming in particular, trying to ``cram'' the work just before the deadline is a sure path to failure. Aim for consistent, steady progress over the course of the semester.
	
	Nobody learns in a vacuum: you are allowed, and indeed encouraged, to discuss your work with your peers. However you must be very careful to avoid falling into \textbf{academic misconduct}, in particular \textbf{plagiarism}. If any part of your solution is \textbf{not your own individual work}, you must make this as clear as possible in your submission, for example in source code comments.
