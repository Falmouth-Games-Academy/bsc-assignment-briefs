In this assignment, you will work as an individual to develop a small game that will be controlled by a custom controller, \textbf{Please note you don't need to develop the controller for this coursework}. When working on the development of the game, the controller must consist of no more than two potentiometers, 1 button and 6 LEDs.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Implement}, a small prototype game of your choice, that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{demonstrate} some gameplay
			\item \textbf{contains} elements that can be controlled by an Arduino
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

Fork the GitHub repository at:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp140-gam160-game}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{Unity} or \textbf{C++/Visual Studio}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}.


\subsection*{Part A}

Part A is the final submission of the code base to the learning space, this should be a zipped version of your GitHub repository. If your project is too large for the learning space, please provide a link to your GitHub Repository.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Game functions correctly
	\item There is an attempt to write well engineered software
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Additional Guidance}
Falmouth University is internationally renowned for the arts. Despite the fact that you are studying for a BSc degree in a technical discipline, you are still expected to strive for the same level of innovation and creative flair as your peers. This assignment is more heavily weighted towards the creative than the assignments you have completed thus far. On this assignment, a competent execution of an unimaginative idea is unlikely to achieve a high grade, as opposed to an imperfect execution of a unique and ambitious concept, which will be seen favourably by examiners. Consider this when working on your design. One approach to promote creativity is divergent thinking: generate ideas by exploring many possible solutions. Often the most interesting ideas are subversive: they deliberately go against the accepted or most obvious solution.

The history of video games is littered with failed peripherals. They were perceived as expensive gimmicks rather than legitimate enhancements to gameplay. Your creativity should be balanced by commercial awareness: your design should be informed by research into products that have succeeded and failed in the past, and what underexploited niches exist in the present. A great project will be highly divergent, but one that has clear commercial viability. Do not be discouraged if you fall short: professionals find it difficult!

We have given you some of the materials you need: an Arduino and other useful components. You will need to add your own materials to produce a functional physical prototype. A \textit{Blue Peter} style prototype made from household items is fine, as is something made out of modelling clay. However you should still choose your materials carefully, as overly flimsy construction may impair functionality.

You may also wish to connect electronic components such as LEDs, buzzers, photoresistors etc to the Arduino, or even use a different, more flexible hard- ware platform such as RaspberryPi. However you are discouraged from spending large sums of money on extra hardware, and doing so is not required to achieve a high mark. If you choose to go down this route, it is possible to purchase a RaspberryPi and other useful peripheral online for around the price of a textbook (up to \pounds40).

You should aim to demonstrate a high level of sophistication in the technical execution of your prototype. An important part of sophistication is having the insight to choose the right tool for the job: if a simpler technique fulfils all the requirements, use it. The use of unnecessarily complicated techniques, serving only to showcase one's own cleverness, is a dangerous habit.

The sole purpose of the recorded demonstration is to aid the external moderators and examiners. Furthermore, any photos and/or videos submitted do not need to be entertaining or highly polished.
