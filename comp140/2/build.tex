}

In this assignment, you will write a proposal and create a poster. 

This proposal will contain a plan for your creative computing project highlighitng your areas fo research and outlining the features and planned components.	This should be written using a word processor and delivered as a \textbf{PDF} document..

The poster will summarise the report, and will capture some of the key design decisions in the 
hardware and software development. This should be written in the provided \textbf{Powerpoint} template.
This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a \textbf{1 page} proposal for a novel game/experience \textbf{and} controller, this is due in the \textbf{proposal review} sessions in \textbf{Week 3}. 
	\item \textbf{Write} a \textbf{draft poster} which provides an overview of your game and controller, this is due in the \textbf{Poster Demo} sessions in \textbf{Week 9}. 
	\item \textbf{Revise} the \textbf{1 page} proposal and poster based on feedback and submit on the \textbf{hand-in} date, this is due for the \textbf{Report Peer Review} in \textbf{Week 10}. 
	\item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual} your final poster at the scheduled viva session
\end{enumerate}


	\subsection*{Assignment Setup}
	
	Fork the GitHub repository at:	
	\indent \url{https://gamesgit.falmouth.ac.uk/projects/COMP140}
	
	Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.
	

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A is a \textbf{single formative submission} of a \textbf{1 page} proposal for a novel game/experience \textbf{and} controller.  

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
		\item \textbf{describe} the game design that will form the basis for your interface;
		\item \textbf{illustrate} basic research into electronic component and physical form factors for controllers;
		\item \textbf{analyse} the design of the controller in detail;
		\item \textbf{list} the key electronic components of your controller
		\item and \textbf{list} the key user stories.
	\end{enumerate}

To complete part A, write your proposal and then show this to a tutor at the \textbf{proposal review} sessions in \textbf{Week 3}

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission} of a \textbf{draft digital poster}.

The poster must contain the following

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item Detail the hardware of the control system
	\item Detail the design of the control system
	\item Detail the elements of the game/experience
	\item UML Diagram of the software architecture
\end{enumerate}

To complete part B, write your draft poster and show this to a tutor at the online \textbf{Poster Demo} session in \textbf{Week 9}

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{peers} and your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. You should download your project from GitHub, and submit a \textbf{zip file} which contains the following

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The project proposal
	\item The final version of your poster
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part D}

	To complete Part D please provide a digital poster (PDF) and present it containing a link to your alternative controller and game/ experience demo video.
	
	You should also share your poster with your peers in the \textbf{Report Peer Review} session in \textbf{Week 10}. 

	You will receive \textbf{immediate informal} feedback from your \textbf{tutor}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}
It is important to keep up with the formative deadlines as receiving and then acting on the feedback 
will not only enable you to achieve a high grade, it will enable you to make a better project. 

When it comes to the poster, you should endevour to limit the amount of text, 
you always should favour images over text. If you use text, please ensure the 
font size is legible on the printed out poster.

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
    		Falmouth University policy states that deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub. 
    		
    	\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\
