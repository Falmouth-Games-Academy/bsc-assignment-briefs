}

In this assignment, you will write a proposal and create a poster. 

This proposal will contain a plan for your creative computing project highlighting your areas for research and outlining the features and planned components.	This should be written using a word processor and delivered as a \textbf{PDF} document..

The poster will summarise your oral report, and will capture some of the key design decisions in the 
hardware and software development. This should be written in the provided template.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a \textbf{short proposal} for your creative computing project
	\item \textbf{Prepare} a \textbf{draft poster} which provides an overview of your creative computing project
	\item \textbf{Revise} the \textbf{poster} based on feedback from your tutor and submit to LearningSpace by the deadline on MyFalmouth
	\item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual}, your \textbf{final poster} at the scheduled demo session
\end{enumerate}


	\subsection*{Assignment Setup}
	
	Continue to use the GitHub repository for your other assignment on this module, which you can fork at:	
	\indent \url{https://gamesgit.falmouth.ac.uk/projects/COMP140}
	
	Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A is a \textbf{single formative submission} of a \textbf{ONE page} proposal for a creative computing project. This work is individual and will be assessed on formative basis. In order to pass, the poster should:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
		\item \textbf{describe} the context that will form the basis for your project;
		\item \textbf{illustrate} basic research into electronic components and physical form factors for your project;
		\item \textbf{analyse} the design of your proposed deliverable in detail;
		\item \textbf{list} the key electronic components of your controller;
		\item and \textbf{list} the key user stories.
	\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, write your proposal and then show this to a tutor in your tutorial session in \textbf{Week 3}.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission} of a \textbf{draft digital poster}. This work is individual and will be assessed on formative basis. In order to pass, the poster should detail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item the hardware of the control system
	\item the design of the control system
	\item important elements of the user experience
	\item an appropriate UML Diagram of the software architecture
\end{enumerate}

To complete part B, prepare a draft of your poster and show this to a tutor in your tutorial session in \textbf{Week 8}.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{peers} and your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis.  Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part C, update the poster based on the feedback that you received in Part B. Then, upload the poster to \texttt{LearningSpace} by the time/date specified in the list of deadlines available on \href{http://myfalmouth.falmouth.ac.uk}{MyFalmouth}. 

You only need to submit the poster itself as a single \texttt{.pdf} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal} feedback from your \textbf{module leader} three weeks after the deadline.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is individual and will be assessed on a criterion-referenced basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail. 

To complete Part D attend the timetabled poster demo session that is expected to take place in \textbf{Week 9}. Present an oral report of your proposal, design, and your work-in-progress, ideally demonstrating a digital or physical prototype of your work. Use the poster to guide the report, making appropriate reference to technical diagrams.
	
You will receive \textbf{immediate informal} feedback from your \textbf{tutor}.
	
\todo[inline]{\textbf{Note:} You should keep a digital copy of your poster handy to share with your peers in a future peer review session that forms part of your other assignment on this module.}

\section*{Additional Guidance}

It is important to keep up with the formative deadlines as receiving and then acting on the feedback will not only enable you to achieve a high grade, it will enable you to make a better project. 

When it comes to the poster, you should endeavour to limit the amount of text, you always should favour images over text. If you use text, please ensure the font size is legible on the printed out poster.

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
    		Falmouth University policy states that deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub. 
    		
    	\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\ 	
    		If you have discovered an issue with the brief itself, the source files are available at: \\
