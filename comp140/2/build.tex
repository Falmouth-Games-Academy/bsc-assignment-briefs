In this assignment, you will write a report and poster. 

This report will be used to capture the development of your project from ideation, development and completion of the project. It will contain some elements of reflection, were you will evaluate the lessons you have learned about the development of the project. This should be written using \textbf{LaTex}.

The poster will summarise the report, and will capture some of the key design decisions in the hardware and software side of things. This should be written in the provided \textbf{Powerpoint} template.
This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a \textbf{1 page} proposal for a novel game/experience \textbf{and} controller, this is due in the \textbf{proposal review} sessions in \textbf{Week 3}. 
	\item \textbf{Write} a \textbf{draft poster} which provides an overview of your game and controller, this is due in the \textbf{Project Presentations} sessions in \textbf{Week 8}. 
	\item \textbf{Write} a draft \textbf{4 page} report which details the development of the project, this is due for the \textbf{Report Peer Review} in \textbf{Week 10}. 
	\item \textbf{Revise} the \textbf{4 page} report and poster based on feedback and submit on the  \textbf{hand-in} date
	\item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual} your final poster at the scheduled viva session
\end{enumerate}


	\subsection*{Assignment Setup}
	
	Fork the GitHub repository at:
	
	\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp140-Development-Report}
	
	Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.
	

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A is a \textbf{single formative submission} of a \textbf{1 page} proposal for a novel game/experience \textbf{and} controller.  

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
		\item \textbf{describe} the game design that will form the basis for your interface;
		\item \textbf{illustrate} basic  research into electronic component and physical form factors for controllers;
		\item \textbf{analyse} the design of the controller in detail;
		\item and \textbf{list} the key user stories.
	\end{enumerate}

To complete part A, write your proposal and then show this to a tutor at the \textbf{proposal review} sessions in \textbf{Week 3}

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. of a \textbf{draft digital poster}.

The poster must contain the following

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item Detail the hardware of the controller
	\item Detail the design of the controller
	\item Detail the elements of the game/experience
	\item UML Diagram of the software architecture
\end{enumerate}

To complete part B, write your draft poster and show this to a tutor at the \textbf{Project Presentation} session in \textbf{Week 8}

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single formative submission}. Write a draft report which must include the following:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item The project proposal
	\item Hardware of the controller, including components
	\item Design of the the controller, including wiring, casing and attachments
	\item The game/experience concept
	\item Software design with UML Diagrams
	\item Reflection on the project
\end{enumerate}

To completed part C, write your draft report and show this to your peers in the \textbf{Report Peer Review} session in \textbf{Week 10}. 

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal} feedback from your \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. You should download your project from GitHub, and submit a \textbf{zip file} which contains the following

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The final version of your report
	\item The final version of your poster
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part E}

	To complete Part E, please print out your poster and present it along with your alternative controller and game/experience/

	You will receive \textbf{immediate informal} feedback from your \textbf{tutor}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}
It is important to keep up with the formative deadlines as receiving and then acting on the feedback will not only enable you to achieve a high grade, it will enable
you to make a better project. 

When it comes to the poster, you should endavour to limit the amount of text, you always should favour images over text. If you use text, please ensure the font size is legible on the printed out poster.

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
    		Falmouth University policy states that deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub. 
    		
    	\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\
