		``As soon as we started programming, we found out to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.''

	In this assignment, you are required to \textbf{create} a game or other playful experience which \textbf{interfaces} with a custom controller.
	
	Experimentation, ingenuity, and creativity are at the heart of everything that professional game developers do. To this end, building your own custom game controller is the perfect place to exercise these characteristics. However, you will also gain invaluable exposure to working with computer hardware. In recent years, there has been considerable growth in the development of new fabrication technologies, such as 3D printers. In addition, electronics, from primitive transistors to complex computer chips, have all become much cheaper. Accessibility to these tools has, therefore, unveiled an unprecedented opportunity to invent and innovate in this space. Increasingly, app developers are augmenting mobile software with new wearable devices, and so to will game developers with the advent and increasing popularity of augmented reality games.
	
	
	This assignment is formed of several parts
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
		\item \textbf{Write}, as an \textbf{individual}, a draft game or other playful experience which interfaces with a custom controller
		\item \textbf{Write}, an an \textbf{individual} a revised version of your project and submit it for Peer Review
		\item \textbf{Write}, as an \textbf{individual}, a final version of your project
		\item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual}, a practical demo of the computer program to your tutor that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
			\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
			\item as well as \textbf{demonstrate} your \textbf{individual} programming \& hardware knowledge.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}


	As this module is about pushing your creativity in creating an experience which blends a physical controller and a digital application, we are going to enforce the following \textbf{constraints} and make some \textbf{recommendations}
	
	\subsection{Constraints}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
		\item You should not recreate a twin stick joypad
		\item You should not build a custom joystick/fighting stick
		\item You should avoid buttons, other sensors could be used instead
		\item You should not submit a bare bread board
		\item You should have a traditional control scheme (keyboard, mouse, keyboard), so your game functionality can be quickly tested 
		\item The main \textbf{readme.md} should be updated with all sources used to create the project
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Recommendations}
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
		\item You should consider building a 2D Game
		\item You should avoid using 3D printed elements in your controller
		\item You should use found objects/recycled objects for your controller
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection*{Assignment Setup}
	
	.Fork the GitHub repository at:
	
	\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp140-Project}
	
	Use the existing directory structure, the Unity Project should be placed inside the \textbf{Unity Project} folder and the Arduino project files should be placed inside \textbf{Arduino Project} folder. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.
	
	\subsection*{Part A}
	
	Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. You should demonstrate your progress to a tutor in the timetabled session in \textbf{Week 6}
	
	The tutor will give immediate feedback in class.
	
	\subsection*{Part B}
	
	Part B consists of a \textbf{single formative submissions}. This will be submitted to the peer review session in the timetabled session in \textbf{Week 9}
	
	You will receive immediate feedback from your peers
	
	
	\subsection*{Part C}
	
	Part C consists of a \textbf{single summative submissions}. You should download your project from GitHub, and submit a \textbf{zip file} which contains the following
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Unity Project including all source code and assets
		\item The Arduino Project
		\item Two images of the controller, one of the wiring and another with case/housing
		\item Footage of the controller and game/experience being played
		\item readme.md with references to all sources and assets used in the project
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\subsection*{Part D}
	To complete Part D, implement the final changes to your project. Prepare a practical demonstration of the project. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session. 
	
	You will receive \textbf{immediate informal} feedback from your \textbf{tutor}.
	
	\section*{Additional Guidance}

	Nobody learns in a vacuum: you are allowed, and indeed encouraged, to discuss your work with your peers. However you must be very careful to avoid falling into \textbf{academic misconduct}, in particular \textbf{plagiarism}. If any part of your solution is \textbf{not your own individual work}, you must make this as clear as possible in your submission, for example in source code comments.
	
	\section*{FAQ}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
		Each worksheet has its own formative deadline, specified on that worksheet and also communicated in class.
		Falmouth University policy states that summative deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
		
		\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub. 
		
		\item 	\textbf{How will I receive feedback on my work?} \\ 
		You will be given verbal feedback on your work during the session in which it is marked.
		If you require more in-depth feedback or discussion, please book an appointment with your tutor.
		
		\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\ 	
		If you have discovered an issue with the brief itself, the source files are available at: \\
		\url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/bsc-assignment-briefs}.\\
		Please make a pull request and comment accordingly.
		
		\item \textbf{What coding standards are we using on this assignment?}\\
		We are using the Microsoft's coding styles for C\# \\
		\url{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions}
