\section*{COMP140 Contracts}

As this module is about pushing your creativity in creating an experience which blends a physical control system and a digital application, we are going to enforce the following \textbf{constraints} and make some \textbf{recommendations}

To give you a wide brief and accommodate a broad range of applications you will \textbf{choose one} of the following two contracts:

\subsection*{Contract 1 - Custom Game Controller}

You have been commissioned to develop a \textbf{game controller and game} for a \textbf{keynote games expo event} that pushes the boundaries of what is possible with common domestic objects and gameplay. Create a game that utilises everyday objects as interfaces to a game world.
	\subsubsection*{Constraints}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item You should not recreate a twin stick joypad
		\item You should not build a custom joystick/fighting stick
		\item You should avoid buttons, other sensors could be used instead!
		\item You should not submit a bare bread board, please build a case or housing around the controller or sensing system
		\item You should have a traditional control scheme (keyboard, mouse, keyboard), so your experience functionality can be quickly tested 
		\item The main \textbf{readme.md} should be updated with all sources used to create the project
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsubsection*{Recommendations}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item You should focus on the interaction between the control system and the game
		\item You should consider a 2D interface to keep the game simple
		\item You should avoid using 3D printed elements in your controller
		\item You should use found objects/recycled objects in concert with electronic components for your control system
	\end{enumerate}
	

\subsection*{Contract 2 - Interactive Musueum Exhibit}

You have been commissioned to develop an \textbf{interactive exhibit} for the \textbf{Natural History Musueum} that explores the interaction between the natural word and the digital. Create a digital environment that is influenced and effected by real world sensors and vice versa.
\subsubsection*{Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item You should avoid buttons, other sensors could be used instead, be creative
	\item You should not submit a bare bread board, please build a case or housing around the controller or sensing system
	\item You should consider how it would be presented to the public in an exhibition space.
	\item You should have a traditional control scheme (keyboard, mouse, keyboard), so your experience functionality can be quickly tested 
	\item The main \textbf{readme.md} should be updated with all sources used to create the project
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Recommendations}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item You should focus on the interaction between the control system and the digital environment
	\item You should avoid using 3D printed elements in your exhibit
	\item You should use found objects/recycled objects in concert with electronic components for your control system

\end{enumerate}
