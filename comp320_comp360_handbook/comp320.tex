\chapter{Assignment Structure for COMP320}

\section*{Introduction}

You are required to deliver a major \textbf{research project} as part of your degree; either in the form of \textbf{empirical research} relating to computing for games, or \textbf{practice-based research} related to game development. Individually, you explore a field that interests you, and for which there is a clearly identified need. This module forms the first part of this project and provides the opportunity to conduct a literature review, as well as to collect and analyse data using appropriate methods and statistics.

These assignments are formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Identify} a project supervisor \textbf{and agree} a topic for your research, by:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{reviewing} the academic literature \textbf{in addition to} the state-of-the-art
			\item \textbf{and deriving} a key question or problem from the review to motivate your work
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Produce} a prototype computing artefact that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{facilitate} the collection of empirical data for your project
			\item \textbf{demonstrate} the technical feasibility of your proposed artefact
			\item \textbf{provide} a basis for further development and
				experimentation in the second study block
		\end{enumerate}
		\textbf{Note that you \textit{must} complete and submit Part C
		\textit{before} carrying out any experimental work.}
	\item \textbf{Complete} an Application for Research Ethics Approval form,
		which will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{briefly propose} the research to be undertaken in your project
			\item \textbf{outline} any potential ethical issues around your proposed work,
				particularly with respect to research involving human subjects
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Incorporate} computational statistics into your prototype computing artefact, indicating how you will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{collect, analyse, and present} data relevant to your research
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Deliver} a 10-minute practice presentation that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{explain} the context of your project
			\item \textbf{identify} and \textbf{discuss} the scientific literature
				relevant to your project
			\item \textbf{propose} one or more research questions for your project

			\item \textbf{illustrate} your approach to collecting, analysing, and presenting data
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \label{part:review-draft} \textbf{Write} a draft research review and proposal
		that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{identify} and \textbf{analyse} the scientific literature
				relevant to your project
			\item \textbf{propose} one or more research questions for your project
			\item \textbf{justify} your choice of research question(s)
				and how they will contribute to the state of knowledge

			\item \textbf{present} your data analysis approach \textbf{and} any preliminary results
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Write} a final research review and proposal that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{address} any issues raised in Part~\ref{part:review-draft}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Deliver} a 10-minute presentation that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{summarise} the context and research question(s)
				of your project

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

These assignments form a \textbf{research} task, consisting of \textbf{literature review}, \textbf{academic writing},
\textbf{software development} and \textbf{scientific experimentation}. For the \textbf{research proposal} with \textbf{prototype computing artefact}, there are no set GitHub repositories. You will instead use BitBucket repositories based at Falmouth University. 

For the \textbf{research review and proposal}, fork the BitBucket repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://gamesgit.falmouth.ac.uk/scm/fyp/dissertation.git}

Use the existing LaTeX template, which is based on the IEEE Transactions style,
to write your research proposal.

For the \textbf{prototype computing artefact}, fork the BitBucket repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://gamesgit.falmouth.ac.uk/scm/fyp/computing-artefact}

You are strongly encouraged to use this repository in order to demonstrate your refactoring process.
Ensure that you set up the \texttt{.gitignore} file for your chosen development environment,
and maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file with design documentation appropriate to your project. Select
an suitable license for your work.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission} early in academic year, by a date agreed with your supervisor.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part A, email your chosen supervisor and agree a topic for your proposal within the area of that
supervisor's expertise. Then, email confirmation of that agreement to the module leader.

You will receive immediate and continuous \textbf{informal feedback} through timetabled weekly meetings with your supervisor.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{multiple formative submissions},
set at the discretion of your project supervisor based on agreed milestones and the nature of your proposed project.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part B, design and implement a computing artefact appropriate to your chosen project.
Create a task board setting out the key requirements for the system,
and identifying which requirements will be tackled this study block
and which are stretch goals to be left until later.
Check the source code into a version control repository regularly.
Ensure your \texttt{readme.md} file contains any information required to build and run the artefact as well as
relevant design documentation (including relevant UML diagrams).

You will not directly submit this work. Instead, your supervisor will track your work on the BitBucket server.

You will receive immediate and continuous \textbf{informal feedback} through meetings with your supervisor.

\todo[inline]{\textbf{Important:} Carrying out \textbf{any} data collection or experimental work
without first securing ethical approval is a breach of Falmouth University's Research Ethics Policy.
This will be treated as a case of academic misconduct, and penalised accordingly.}

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part C, download the Research Ethics Approval Application Form
from the LearningSpace. Complete the form in consultation with your project supervisor.
Note that you will need to write a (brief) research proposal for this form. Print and sign the form, 
and hand it to your supervisor for approval.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your supervisor and a \textbf{decision} 
after the ethics committee have convened, according to the academic calendar.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D consists of a \textbf{multiple formative submissions},
set at the discretion of your project supervisor based on agreed milestones and the nature of your proposed project.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.
