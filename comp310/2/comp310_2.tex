    The MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor was first produced in 1975. It powered many influential computers and games consoles throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including the Atari 2600, Apple II, Commodore 64, and Nintendo Entertainment System.
}

In this assignment, you will collaborate to create a wiki focussing on 6502 assembly programming and homebrew NES game development.

There is an active hobbyist community around NES game development on the internet.
There are many sources of information available,
from blogs and forum posts to online tutorials to technical manuals.
However like all information on the internet, it varies in quality and is sometimes disorganised.
In this assignment you will collaborate to bring together this information into a single wiki,
which should serve as a reference for your constrained development task.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft outline in the wiki, that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{Identify} the key topics to be covered by the wiki
    		\item \textbf{Structure} these topics in a sensible way
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Populate} the wiki with content that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{Explain} key concepts around 6502 and NES development
    		\item \textbf{Present} useful information for reference purposes
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Discuss} your contribution to the wiki with your tutor in the viva session in class.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{wiki task}. Find the wiki at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp310-wiki/wiki}

Edit the wiki directly. Note that you are \textbf{not} required to fork or commit to the GitHub repository
for this assignment.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative}.

To complete Part A, as a class, begin populating the wiki with an outline of the topics to be covered.
Discuss and iterate upon this as a class.
It is expected that the edit log for the wiki will show that everyone has contributed to this process.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback} in class in week 4.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative}.

To complete Part B, populate the wiki with content.
Again, this is expected to be an iterative process to which everybody contributes.

Please ensure that all changes have been made to the wiki by the deadline. 

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the deadline.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative}.

To complete Part C, attend the scheduled viva session.
Be prepared to identify and discuss your contributions to the wiki.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Your research journal is intended to support your work on your portfolio task,
therefore this should inform your choice of topics to cover.
You will inevitably carry out research whilst working on the portfolio task;
use the wiki to capture the information you find.

You will need to use a variety of sources for this research task.
By all means seek out peer-reviewed scholarly sources reporting primary research,
but these are unlikely to contain the level of technical detail required for this task.
Whatever sources you use, you should be able to justify them as appropriate and reliable.

A common pitfall is to focus too much on summarising the content of the sources you have read.
For higher marks you need to demonstrate \textbf{insight} into what you have read:
forming inferences and analyses beyond what is written in the original source.
Some questions you might ask yourself are:
Why did the author choose a particular approach?
Is there anything counterintuitive or surprising?
Do you disagree with any of the assumptions or claims?
Does the source suggest further questions?

A related pitfall is to structure the wiki as a sequence of disconnected entries.
Instead aim to \textbf{synthesise} multiple sources into a cohesive whole,
drawing together information from different sources.
Forming a holistic picture of a field is much more valuable than simply understanding individual works.

The wiki is primarily intended to become a useful shared resource for the cohort.
As such, students are expected to direct themselves and their peers in populating, structuring and editing the wiki.
Note that a wiki is not a piece of academic writing
and thus will tend to have a less formal tone than you should be aiming for in other pieces of written work.
Edits may be required to ensure a consistent tone for the wiki.

The tutor \emph{will} check the edit logs of the wiki when assessing the criteria listed below.
This is not only to assess the quantity of contributions made,
but also their nature.
The ideal situation is that every page will have contributions from several authors,
as opposed to pages being primarily authored by a single person with little input from others.
Reading and improving the work of others is just as important as generating new content.
