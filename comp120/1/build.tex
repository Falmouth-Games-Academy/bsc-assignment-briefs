``Bad programming is easy. [People] can learn it in 21 days, even if they are dummies… [Good programming requires a] willingness to devote a large portion of one's life to deliberative practice… So go ahead, buy that book; you'll probably get some use out of it. But you won't change your life or your real expertise as a programmer in 21 days… How about working hard to continually improve over 24 months? Well, now you're starting to get somewhere…''

\section*{Introduction}

\paragraph{In this assignment, you are required to write a computer program that will \textit{tinker} with an existing digital graphic in a creative way.}

\paragraph{Creative computing encompasses the broad realms of digital media, computer programming, and human-computer interaction. It is important to draw these areas together in an applied way. You will, therefore, leverage the principles you have learned to exercise your creativity through computer software. This will prepare you to tackle challenges in many creative domains.}

\paragraph{This assignment is formed of several parts:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Select}, as a \textbf{pair}, \textbf{ONE} of the contracts provided by your tutor and:
    	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item \textbf{state} which contract you will work on;
    		\item \textbf{list} the requirements implied by the contract;
    		\item \textbf{declare} the terms of your software license;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write}, as a \textbf{pair}, a draft computer program that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item \textbf{address} the requirements implied by the contract and relevant intellectual property law;
    		\item \textbf{implement} at least \textbf{FOUR} algorithms for tinkering graphics;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write}, as a \textbf{pair}, a final computer program that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual}, a practical demo of the computer program to your tutor that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
    		\item as well as \textbf{demonstrate} your \textbf{individual} programming knowledge.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

\paragraph{This assignment is a \textbf{pair programming task}. Fork the repository at:}

\url{https://gamesgit.falmouth.ac.uk/scm/comp120/comp120-tinkering-graphics.git}

\paragraph{Extend the repository with sub-directories as appropriate. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{README.md} and \texttt{LICENSE.md} files. Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{C\#} and your development environment of choice.}

\subsection*{Part A}

\paragraph{Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.}

\paragraph{To complete Part A, write about your contract in the relevant LearningSpace activity. Show this to your tutor in your timetabled meeting. You are to select \textbf{ONE} contract to tackle together with your partner and to suggest an appropriate license for your code. If acceptable, this will be signed-off.}

\paragraph{You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.}

\subsection*{Part B}

\paragraph{Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item A valid software license is declared;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{To complete Part B, prepare a draft version of the computer program. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to version control and a link is submitted to the peer-review workshop activity on LearningSpace prior to the scheduled peer-review session. You may have to set permissions on your repository to allow other students to review your code. Then, attend the scheduled peer-review session.}

\paragraph{You are expected to translate technical notation into executable code. As such, it is anticipated that you incorporate \textbf{FOUR} of the listed algorithms into your solution. Clearly list these algorithms and state where they are implemented in the \texttt{README.md} file. You are welcome to use third-party libraries and resources in your solution, but these will not `count' as translations.}

\paragraph{You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{peers}.}

\subsection*{Part C}

\paragraph{Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.}

\paragraph{To complete Part C, revise the computer program based on the feedback you have received. Then, push it into version control. Formal submissions are through the LearningSpace, in this case a link to your repository on GamesGIT. Only one of you needs to submit the link to the repository on LearningSpace.}

\paragraph{You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} three weeks after the final submission deadline.}

\subsection*{Part D}

\paragraph{Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.  The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Enough work is available to hold a meaningful discussion;
	\item Clear evidence of programming knowledge;
	\item No breaches of academic integrity.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{To complete Part D, prepare a practical demonstration of your computer program. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to version control and available to assessors prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session.}

\paragraph{There is a clear expectation that you pair program with your partner. As such, you should \textbf{EACH} be able to explain the solution individually. In the viva you will discuss the key programming constructs used in your solution, the key design decisions made when structuring the code, and how functionality was achieved. This is your opportunity to demonstrate your academic integrity and individual programming knowledge. }

\paragraph{You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.}

\section*{Additional Guidance}

\paragraph{It is critically important that you do not neglect your individual roles in the development process. Programming in pairs means that you work together on the same computer---switching between driver and navigator. It is a great opportunity to develop your technical communication skills and overcome common misconceptions about programming. It should not, however, be treated as a 'free ride'---you will get to review each others' progress.}

\paragraph{You are being expected to \textit{transform} and \textit{repurpose} encodings (i.e. manipulating existing pictures). However, you may create your own images if desired. When using images you have not authored yourself, the source should be noted in the README.md file and all relevant rights (e.g., copyright) acknowledged. }

\paragraph{You can and should go beyond the techniques introduced in the lectures and the Guzdial book (e.g. researching algorithms for producing or manipulating graphics).}

\paragraph{You are not being assessed on speed or memory performance. Do not worry too much about framerate, etc.}

\paragraph{A common pitfall is poor planning or time management. Often, students underestimate how much work is involved in first learning programming concepts and then actually applying them. Programming is quite unlike other subjects in that it cannot be crammed into a last minute deluge just before a deadline. It is, therefore, very important that you begin work early and sustain a consistent pace: little and often.}

\paragraph{The first deadline is quite close to the start of the course and not much material will have been covered by this point. Please rest assured. This first formative submission is supposed to be a simple analysis of requirements. We expect there to be errors. However, it is very important to make a start on this project so you receive early feedback to give you some direction and to encourage you to practice your programming skills across the entire duration of the course. Ideally, you should be programming every day!}

\paragraph{The peer-review component of this work does sometimes raise alarm. However, the only way to learn how to review code is by reviewing code. Your tutor will guide you through the process and provide advice. With practice, it will become clear what is satisfactory by discussing the quality of work with your peers and your tutor during the peer review sessions.}
