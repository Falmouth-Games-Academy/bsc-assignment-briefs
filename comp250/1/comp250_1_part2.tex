\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
``To be enjoyable, an AI must put up a good fight but lose more often than win. It must make the player feel clever, sly, cunning, and powerful. It must make the player jump from his seat shouting, `Take that, you little s**t!'\thinspace''

    Not all video games portray AI in a positive light.
    However, many games rely on AI to create a satisfying gameplay experience.
}

In this assignment, you are required to design and implement \textbf{two} software artefacts.
First, you will create a \textbf{game component}, integrating one or more artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
into one of your game development projects from another module.
Second, you will create a \textbf{MicroRTS bot}: an AI agent that plays a simple real-time strategy (RTS) game,
which will compete in a tournament against your classmates' bots.

Almost all types of games use AI in some capacity, and many genres rely on advanced AI techniques.
Control of non-player characters is an important application of AI,
and a wide-ranging one: enemy AI in a realistic stealth game is very different from in an arcade shooter,
which in turn differs from a racing game.
Other applications of AI can include adversaries in board, card or strategy games,
procedural content generators,
procedural narrative engines,
assistive technologies,
AI ``directors'',
and many others.
Your final output will be a pair of portfolio pieces, which you can use in future to demonstrate your mastery of these techniques.

This assignment is formed of several parts. For the \textbf{game component}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Write} a 2-page handout that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{outline} the concept of your component;
			\item \textbf{identify} the game into which your component will be integrated, and how it will fit into
				the overall game concept;
			\item \textbf{describe} the key requirements of your component.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Populate} a Trello board with the user stories for your component.
	\item \textbf{Implement} a draft version of your component that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{implement} the user stories from your Trello board.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Implement} a final version of your program that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

For the \textbf{MicroRTS bot}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*),resume]
	\item \textbf{Do} some stuff
\end{enumerate}

Finally:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*),resume]
	\item \textbf{Present} a practical demo of your game component and your MicroRTS bot that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
			\item \textbf{demonstrate} your individual programming knowledge and communication skills.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment comprises a pair of \textbf{programming} tasks.

For the \textbf{game component} task, there is no template GitHub repository;
you should work within the existing source control repository for your game
or create a new GitHub repository as appropriate.
Either way, remember to modify the \texttt{.gitignore} file (or equivalent in other version control systems) to exclude temporary build files
from the repository.
It is expected that your component will be implemented in C\# if your game is built in Unity,
or a combination of C++, Blueprints and behaviour trees if your game is built in Unreal.
However you may use any programming languages or environments that are appropriate to your project.

For the \textbf{MicroRTS bot} task, begin by forking the following GitHub repository:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp250-bot}

Modify the provided template code to implement your bot.
The base repository's \texttt{readme.md} file contains important instructions for submitting your bot to the tournament server;
be sure to read and follow these instructions carefully.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. Answer the following questions to pass:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the title and high concept of the game or demo into which your component will be integrated?
	\item What functionality will your component include?
	\item How does your component fit into the overall concept of the game or demo?
	\item What are the key requirements?
	\item Is the scope appropriate for the product development time-frame?
\end{itemize}

To complete Part A, prepare the handout using any word processing tool.
Your handout may include images and/or links to online videos.
In addition, create a Trello board and populate it with your user stories.

Show the handout to the \textbf{tutor} for immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. Answer the following questions to pass:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What are the user stories for your component?
	\item Which user stories are required for a minimum viable product, and which are stretch goals?
	\item Is the scope appropriate for the product development time-frame?
\end{itemize}

To complete Part B, populate a Trello board with your user stories.

Show the Trello board to the \textbf{tutor} for immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare draft versions of the computer programs. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled sprint review sessions. Then, attend the scheduled sprint review sessions.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part D, revise the computer program based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload it to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} three weeks after the final submission deadline.

\subsection*{Part E}

Part E is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.  The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Enough work is available to hold a meaningful discussion;
	\item Clear evidence of programming knowledge \textbf{and} communication skills;
	\item No breaches of academic integrity.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part E, prepare a practical demonstration of the computer program. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

As always, avoid underestimating the effort required to implement even simple software; always consider scope.
From the proposal stage, you should consider very carefully what is feasible.

Your code will be assessed on \textbf{functional coherence}:
how well the finished product corresponds to the user stories,
and whether it has any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.

%Unlike your previous assignments,
%you will be assessed on the \textbf{performance} of your solution.
%Real-time graphics and simulation are not just about creating aesthetically pleasing effects,
%but doing so whilst maintaining a smooth and consistent framerate free of any lag or glitches that might frustrate the player.
%It may be necessary to trade-off the complexity or fidelity of an effect
%in order to achieve acceptable performance.

Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, libraries, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for complexity  
where something simpler would have sufficed.
Likewise, if you are using an engine such as Unity or Unreal,
you should make use of (and build upon) the AI functionality included therein;
you will \textbf{not} receive extra credit for ``rolling your own'' without good reason to do so.

\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve code comprehension,
and carefully choose the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
Use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation}.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
Consider allowing some literal values, where appropriate, to be ``tinkered'' without changing the source code,
e.g.\ by defining them in an external file read at startup.

As with all assignments on this course, you are expected to display a level of
\textbf{innovation and creative flair} befitting Falmouth University's reputation as a world-leading
arts institution.
One approach to promoting creativity is
\textbf{divergent thinking}: generating ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
Often the most interesting ideas are \textbf{subversive}: they deliberately go against
convention or obvious solutions.

%You will \textbf{not} be judged on the quality of your art assets.
%It is fine to use meshes and textures found online,
%as long as they are available under an appropriate license and are properly attributed.
