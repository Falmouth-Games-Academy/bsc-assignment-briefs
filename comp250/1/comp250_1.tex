\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
``To be enjoyable, an AI must put up a good fight but lose more often than win. It must make the player feel clever, sly, cunning, and powerful. It must make the player jump from his seat shouting, `Take that, you little s**t!'\thinspace''

    Not all video games portray AI in a positive light.
    However, many games rely on AI to create a satisfying gameplay experience.
}

In this assignment, you are required to \textbf{design} and \textbf{implement} a game component
implementing one or more artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.
Note that ``component'' here may also include tools to help game designers to author AI behaviours or systems.

It is strongly recommended that your component is integrated into your COMP240 group game development project,
however if this is not appropriate you may integrate it into another of your current or previous development projects.
You may use any programming language and game engine you deem appropriate,
including visual scripting languages such as Blueprints;
this choice will probably be dictated by your choice of game.

Almost all types of games use AI in some capacity, and many genres rely on advanced AI techniques.
Control of non-player characters is an important application of AI,
and a wide-ranging one: enemy AI in a realistic stealth game is very different from in an arcade shooter,
which in turn differs from a racing game.
Other applications of AI can include adversaries in board, card or strategy games,
procedural content generators,
procedural narrative engines,
assistive technologies,
AI ``directors'',
and many others.
Your final product will be a portfolio piece, which you can use in future to demonstrate your mastery of these techniques.

This assignment is formed of several parts:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Write} a 2-page handout that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{outline} the concept of your component;
			\item \textbf{identify} the game into which your component will be integrated, and how it will fit into
				the overall game concept;
			\item \textbf{describe} the key requirements of your component.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Implement} a draft versions of your component that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{implement} the user stories from your Trello board.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Implement} a final version of your component that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Present} a practical demo of the computer program to your tutor that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
			\item \textbf{demonstrate} your individual programming knowledge and communication skills.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{programming} task.
There is no template GitHub repository for this assignment;
you should work within the existing source control repository for your game
or create a new GitHub repository as appropriate.
Either way, remember to modify the \texttt{.gitignore} file (or equivalent on other version control systems) to exclude temporary build files
from the repository.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. Answer the following questions to pass:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the title and high concept of the game or demo into which your component will be integrated?
	\item What functionality will your component include?
	\item How does your component fit into the overall concept of the game or demo?
	\item What are the key requirements?
	\item Is the scope appropriate for the product development time-frame?
\end{itemize}

To complete Part A, prepare the handout using any word processing tool.
Your handout may include images and/or links to online videos.

Show the handout to the \textbf{tutor} for immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a draft version of your component.
Upload the game project to the peer review section on LearningSpace prior to the timetabled peer review session;
if it is too large to upload, bring it to the session on a USB flash drive.
Include a \texttt{readme.md} file detailing which parts of the project constitute your component for this assignment.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part C, revise your component based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload your game project to the LearningSpace.
Include a \texttt{readme.md} file detailing which parts of the project constitute your component for this assignment.
If your project exceeds the 1GB limit for LearningSpace uploads, you are advised to remove unnecessary assets ---
you need only include enough content (e.g.\ one level) to allow your AI component to be assessed.

Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file, which must include your submissions for
\textbf{both} Task 1 (Game Component) \textbf{and} Task 2 (MicroRTS Bot).

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} three weeks after the final submission deadline.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.  The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Enough work is available to hold a meaningful discussion;
	\item Clear evidence of programming knowledge \textbf{and} communication skills;
	\item No breaches of academic integrity.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part D, prepare a practical demonstration of the computer program. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

As always, avoid underestimating the effort required to implement even simple software; always consider scope.
From the proposal stage, you should consider very carefully what is feasible.

Your code will be assessed on \textbf{functional coherence}:
how well the finished product corresponds to the user stories,
and whether it has any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.

%Unlike your previous assignments,
%you will be assessed on the \textbf{performance} of your solution.
%Real-time graphics and simulation are not just about creating aesthetically pleasing effects,
%but doing so whilst maintaining a smooth and consistent framerate free of any lag or glitches that might frustrate the player.
%It may be necessary to trade-off the complexity or fidelity of an effect
%in order to achieve acceptable performance.

Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, libraries, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for complexity  
where something simpler would have sufficed.
Likewise, if you are using an engine such as Unity or Unreal,
you should make use of (and build upon) the AI functionality included therein;
you will \textbf{not} receive extra credit for ``rolling your own'' without good reason to do so.

\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve code comprehension,
and carefully choose the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
Use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation}.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
Where appropriate, values should be exposed as properties or variables in the Unity or Unreal editor
so that they can easily be ``\textbf{tinkered}'' without changing the source code.

Maintainability is also important when using \textbf{visual scripting} systems such as \textbf{Blueprints}.
Pay special attention to the \textbf{layout} of your Blueprints,
which should be tidy and should make clear the flow of control and data.
Use \textbf{grouping}, \textbf{macros}, \textbf{functions}, \textbf{routing nodes} etc.\ to achieve this.
Blueprints which resemble bowls of spaghetti will not achieve high marks!

As with all assignments on this course, you are expected to display a level of
\textbf{innovation and creative flair} befitting Falmouth University's reputation as a world-leading
arts institution.
One approach to promoting creativity is
\textbf{divergent thinking}: generating ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
Often the most interesting ideas are \textbf{subversive}: they deliberately go against
convention or obvious solutions.

%You will \textbf{not} be judged on the quality of your art assets.
%It is fine to use meshes and textures found online,
%as long as they are available under an appropriate license and are properly attributed.
