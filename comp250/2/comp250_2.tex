In this assignment, you will collaborate to create a wiki detailing your research on artificial intelligence (AI).

Familiarity with the academic literature is extremely helpful for the computing professional,
both to understand the seminal works that lay the foundations of the field,
and to keep abreast of recent developments at the cutting edge.
Games technology is a fast-moving field, and keeping up is important.
However scientific papers are written in a way that is sometimes daunting to newcomers,
so it is essential to practice the skill of reading and comprehending such papers.
Keeping a research journal is a useful way to record your thoughts
(questions, hypotheses, connections, ideas, ...) as you explore the literature.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft outline in the wiki, that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{Identify} the key topics to be covered by the wiki
    		\item \textbf{Structure} these topics in a sensible way
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Populate} the wiki with content that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{Explain} key concepts around 6502 and NES development
    		\item \textbf{Present} useful information for reference purposes
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Discuss} your contribution to the wiki with your tutor in the viva session in class.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{wiki task}. Find the wiki at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp310-wiki/wiki}

Edit the wiki directly. Note that you are \textbf{not} required to fork or commit to the GitHub repository
for this assignment.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative}.

To complete Part A, as a class, begin populating the wiki with an outline of the topics to be covered.
Discuss and iterate upon this as a class.
It is expected that the edit log for the wiki will show that everyone has contributed to this process.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback} in class in week 4.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative}.

To complete Part B, populate the wiki with content.
Again, this is expected to be an iterative process to which everybody contributes.

Please ensure that all changes have been made to the wiki by the deadline.

To submit, clone the wiki to your local machine using Git.
Compress the wiki as a \texttt{.zip} file and upload it to the submission area on LearningSpace.
Note that although this is a collaborative assignment,
\textbf{everyone must} submit individually via LearningSpace.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the deadline.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative}.

To complete Part C, attend the scheduled viva session.
Be prepared to identify and discuss your contributions to the wiki.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Your research journal is intended to support your work on your portfolio task,
therefore this should inform your choice of topics to cover.
You will inevitably carry out research whilst working on the portfolio task;
use the wiki to capture the information you find.

You will need to use a variety of sources for this research task.
By all means seek out peer-reviewed scholarly sources reporting primary research,
but these are unlikely to contain the level of technical detail required for this task.
Whatever sources you use, you should be able to justify them as appropriate and reliable.

A common pitfall is to focus too much on summarising the content of the sources you have read.
For higher marks you need to demonstrate \textbf{insight} into what you have read:
forming inferences and analyses beyond what is written in the original source.
Some questions you might ask yourself are:
Why did the author choose a particular approach?
Is there anything counterintuitive or surprising?
Do you disagree with any of the assumptions or claims?
Does the source suggest further questions?

A related pitfall is to structure the wiki as a sequence of disconnected entries.
Instead aim to \textbf{synthesise} multiple sources into a cohesive whole,
drawing together information from different sources.
Forming a holistic picture of a field is much more valuable than simply understanding individual works.

The wiki is primarily intended to become a useful shared resource for the cohort.
As such, students are expected to direct themselves and their peers in populating, structuring and editing the wiki.
Note that a wiki is not a piece of academic writing
and thus will tend to have a less formal tone than you should be aiming for in other pieces of written work.
Edits may be required to ensure a consistent tone for the wiki.

The tutor \emph{will} check the edit logs of the wiki when assessing the criteria listed below.
This is not only to assess the quantity of contributions made,
but also their nature.
The ideal situation is that every page will have contributions from several authors,
as opposed to pages being primarily authored by a single person with little input from others.
Reading and improving the work of others is just as important as generating new content.

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
    		Falmouth University policy states that deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub. 
    		
    	\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\ 	
    		If you have discovered an issue with the brief itself, the source files are available at: \\
