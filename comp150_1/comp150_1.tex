In this assignment, you will conduct research on the agile development methodology in order to bring an academic perspective into your working practice. Specifically, your research will explore: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item What is the agile philosophy?
    \item How should developers apply agile principles in the games industry?
\end{enumerate}

Communication and working practices are both important to employers in the games industry. Problems arising from miscommunicated requirements are a large avoidable cost, and  productivity is highly valued. Additionally, research skills will help you with your future professional development. Most critically, moving beyond just textbooks and websites to academic peer-reviewed papers will help you to keep your skills up to date in the future.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a 200-word proposal \textbf{with} references which must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{state} a specific research question which you intend to address;
    		\item \textbf{describe} the way in which you intend to address the question;
    		\item and then \textbf{list} at least \textbf{6} appropriate academic references to use to support your research.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as a \textbf{group}, a 15-minute summary of your research that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describe} the key findings of your research;
    		\item and \textbf{discuss how} these findings apply to working practice.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft 1000-word essay which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{address} the specific researh queston raised in the proposal.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a final 1000-word essay which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is an \textbf{academic writing task}. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp150-agile}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{TeX}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Research question is appropriate and distinctive;
	\item At least six academic peer-reviewed sources are cited.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, write your proposal in the \texttt{readme.md} document and then prepare the reference list using a \texttt{*.bib} file.  Show these to your tutor.  If acceptable, this will be signed-off. 

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Research questions are adequetely addressed;
	\item Some evidence of academic rigor;
	\item Some insight into the relationship between theory and practice.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a presentation that summarises your research findings. Prepare your slideshow collaboratively in TeX. Use the combined reference list of the group to broadly discuss each individual research question. Help each other. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub prior to the scheduled session. Then, attend the scheduled session.

You will receive \textbf{peer feedback} within 3 working days after the session.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare a draft version of the essay. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled session. Then, attend the scheduled session.

You will receive \textbf{peer feedback} within 3 working days after the session.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. The following criteria are used to allocate marks:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Appropriateness of Referenced Articles;
	\item Relevance to and Focus on the Research Questions;
	\item Depth of Insight into the Agile Philosophy;
	\item Specificity, Verifiability, and Accuracy of Claims;
	\item Adequacy of Analysis of Research Articles;	
	\item Adequacy of Discussion on Transfer to the Games Industry;
	\item Quality of Academic Writing;
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part D, revise the essay based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload the essay to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.pdf} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Use your experience from the previous essays. Identify weaknesses and feed-\textit{forward}. University is an opportunity for improvement and an effective way to do this is to compare past and current performance.

Areas where students tend to lose marks are: depth of insight; analytical skill; and evaluative skill. Depth of insight implies rigorous research, addressing one key challenge in much detail, rather than several challenges with weaker research and/or in less detail. Adequete analysis implies going beyond mere descrption, perhaps through: performing calculatons, comparing sources, or even deploying reasoning to generate new insights. Adequete evaluation implies making appropriate reference to evidence and ensuring that evidence is of appropriate quality. Further to this, sound and valid arguments are constructed, criticising the claims made by other authors.

Focus on answering your research question. You have but 1000-words! Depth over breadth. Quality over quantitiy. Write concisely. Your ability to recall facts is not under assessment, your ability to construct an argument through critical analysis and making it relevant to practice is.
