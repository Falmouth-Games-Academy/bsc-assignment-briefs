\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you critically reflect on your progress across the Semester. This involves reviewing key weaknesses that influence the quality of your work. From this, you develop plans of continuing personal development.

Such reflection and planning is an extremely important part of learning games development. Research shows that deliberate practice is very effective at nurturing expertise in software engineering. Everyone properly adopting this technique eventually succeeds, despite the challenging nature of the subject.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a series of brief weekly reports (about 100-200 words) that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describe} your progress;
    		\item \textbf{assess} at least \textbf{one} challenge that you have encountered;
    		\item and then \textbf{outline} some specific actions that will help you to overcome these problems.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft 1200-word report that must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{identify five} key skills that you consider obstacles;
    		\item \textbf{justify} the relevance \textbf{and} importance of \textbf{each} of these skills, with respect to professional game development;
    		\item \textbf{assess} your application of \textbf{each} of these skills, \textit{describing how} they affected the quality of your work;
    		\item and then \textbf{suggest how} to overcome \textbf{each} of these obstacles, with reference to SMART actions.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a final 1200-word report that must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{reflective writing task} and so regular reflection is expected. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp150-cpd}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file. 

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{TeX}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Progress has been described with adequate detail;
	\item Problems and issues have been clearly explained and assessed;
	\item There is evidence of reflection;
	\item At least one appropriate SMART objective has been actioned;
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, write each report in the \texttt{readme.md} document. Separate each week with a heading. Attend the scheduled catch-up tutorials and show the document to your tutor.  If acceptable, these will be signed-off. 

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a draft version of the reflective report. Use the marking rubric to inform the structure of the document. Ensure that the TeX source and compiled \texttt{*.pdf} are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled code review session. Then, attend the scheduled code review session.

You will receive \textbf{peer feedback} within 3 working days after the code review session.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the assessment criteria in the marking rubric at the end of this document for further insight.

To complete Part C, revise the reflective report based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload the reflective report to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{*.pdf} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

\textbf{Reflection} is taking time to examine thoughts, feelings, beliefs, values, attitudes and assumptions in the context of a specific topic, situation, problem, issue, or process. Part of reflection is relating these varied understandings to your experience, then analysing how and why something arose. Building upon this, you can predict future performance and consequently propose ways to improve future performance.

A common mistake made by beginners to reflective writing is to merely describe the context and/or the experience. Avoid this. Description is not particularly important. It is the \textbf{analysis} and \textbf{evaluation} of an experience which is important. This is because it will reveal insights about yourself and your actions, which will help you to focus on the most relevant weaknesses.

Programming is a skill that requires a significant investment in time and energy to develop. Of course, regular practice is important. However, \textbf{quality} of practice is more important than \textbf{quantity} of practice.

Deliberate practice is a continuous cycle of reflection, planning and practice. This means that \textbf{reflection is a forethought} rather than an afterthought. Avoid leaving reflection to the last minute. Focus on the ongoing development process early, and indeed, on the process itself. The quality of the end product may indicate the existence of challenges, but it is only through deep reflection on working practice that it becomes clear why those challenges arose and how to avoid them.

Effective deliberate practice is: conscious and intentional; designed with current skill in mind, forcing discomfort while avoiding frustration; provides relevant measures to track progress; and follows a repeatable structure.

A common mistake when planning such practice is being too general. Consider \textbf{SMART} actions: \textbf{specific}; \textbf{measurable}; \textbf{achievable}; \textbf{relevant}; and \textbf{time-bound}. Ensure that your plan for future development meets all five of these criteria. Also note, problem solving and designing are particularly important programming skills and approaches to developing skills in these areas can be relevant.

When choosing which \textbf{skills} to focus on for this report, be specific. Avoid choosing broad skills that are clearly important for any student, such as ``time management'' or ``communication''. Instead, consider which \textbf{specific} aspects of these skills are a priority for \textbf{you}. We are not assessing your knowledge of general study skills, rather we are assessing your ability to analyse and reflect on your own learning as an individual.
