	In this assignment you will work as an individual to develop a game which supports a novel alternative controller. At this stage you will be focusing on the design and the development of the game using object orientated concepts. You will also create a concept for alternative controller which will be used with the game.
	
	Experimentation, ingenuity, and creativity are at the heart of everything that professional game developers do. To this end, building your own custom game controller is the perfect place to exercise these characteristics. However, you will also gain invaluable exposure to working with computer hardware. In recent years, there has been considerable growth in the development of new fabrication technologies, such as 3D printers. In addition, electronics, from primitive transistors to complex computer chips, have all become much cheaper. Accessibility to these tools has, therefore, unveiled an unprecedented opportunity to invent and innovate in this space. Increasingly, app developers are augmenting mobile software with new wearable devices, and so to will game developers with the advent and increasing popularity of augmented reality games.
	
	This assignment is formed of several parts:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
		\item \textbf{Write}, a proposal for a game that uses an alternative controller which contains:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
			\item \textbf{describe} the game
			\item \textbf{describe} the core game mechanics
		\end{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Write} a proposal for an alternative controller which contains: 
		\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
			\item \textbf{research} into existing alt-Controllers
			\item \textbf{description} of the physical controller
			\item \textbf{design} of physical controller
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Practical \textbf{demonstration} of the game, this should
		\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
			\item \textbf{demonstrate} your understanding of Object Orientated concepts
			\item \textbf{reflection} of your performance to date
			\item \textbf{description} of tasks to completed
			\item revised \textbf{design} of physical controller
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection*{Assignment Setup}
	
	Fork the GitHub repository at:
	
	\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp140-gam160-game}
	
	Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.
	
	Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{Unity} or \textbf{Unreal}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 
	
	\subsection*{Part A}
	
	Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item Submission is timely;
		\item Choice of game is feasible;
		\item Design is distinctive and has creative merit.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	To complete part A, write your proposal in the \texttt{readme.md} document. This should use the \textbf{markdown} syntax, for additional guidance, please read the following  
	
	\indent \url{https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet}
	
	Show this to your tutor in-class. If acceptable, this will be signed-off.
	
	\subsection*{Part B}
	
	Part B is formed of \textbf{single formative submissions}. This will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item Submission is timely;
		\item Research activities are exhaustive which are well referenced
		\item Description of the controller 
		\item Design is distinctive and has creative merit.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	To complete Part B, write your proposal in the \texttt{readme.md} document using markdown syntax.
	
	You will receive \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.
	
	\subsection*{Part C}
	
	To complete Part C, implement your prototype game utilising a fast, iterative development process. Prepare a practical demonstration of the game. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session. 
	
	You will receive \textbf{immediate informal} feedback from your \textbf{tutor}.
	
	\section*{Additional Guidance}
	Falmouth University is internationally renowned for the arts. Despite the fact that you are studying for a BSc degree in a technical discipline, you are still expected to strive for the same level of innovation and creative flair as your peers. This assignment is more heavily weighted towards the creative than the assignments you have completed thus far. On this assignment, a competent execution of an unimaginative idea is unlikely to achieve a high grade, as opposed to an imperfect execution of a unique and ambitious concept, which will be seen favourably by examiners. Consider this when working on your design. One approach to promote creativity is divergent thinking: generate ideas by exploring many possible solutions. Often the most interesting ideas are subversive: they deliberately go against the accepted or most obvious solution.
	
	The history of video games is littered with failed peripherals. They were perceived as expensive gimmicks rather than legitimate enhancements to gameplay. Your creativity should be balanced by commercial awareness: your design should be informed by research into products that have succeeded and failed in the past, and what underexploited niches exist in the present. A great project will be highly divergent, but one that has clear commercial viability. Do not be discouraged if you fall short: professionals find it difficult! 
	
	You should aim to demonstrate a high level of sophistication in the technical execution of your prototype. An important part of sophistication is having the insight to choose the right tool for the job: if a simpler technique fulfils all the requirements, use it. The use of unnecessarily complicated techniques, serving only to showcase one's own cleverness, is a dangerous habit. 
	
	The sole purpose of the recorded demonstration is to aid the external moderators and examiners. Furthermore, any photos and/or videos submitted do not need to be entertaining or highly polished.
