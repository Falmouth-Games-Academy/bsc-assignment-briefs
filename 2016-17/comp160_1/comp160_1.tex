In this assignment, you will research software engineering principles to bring an academic perspective to your working practice. Specifically, to explore: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Which engineering challenges are prominent in game development;
    \item and how software engineering principles are applied to digital games.
\end{enumerate}

Working practices are important to employers in the games industry. Problems arising from poor software design and ineffective quality assurance practices are largely avoidable. As such, the key principles of software engineering are widely used in the games industry. They are essential to learn. Additionally, research skills will help you with your professional development. Most critically, moving beyond textbooks and websites to the academic literature, which will help you to keep your skills up to date in the future.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a 200-word proposal \textbf{with} references which must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{state} a problem associated with the given challenge area;
    		\item \textbf{describe} the way in which you intend to address the question;
    		\item and then \textbf{list} at least \textbf{10} appropriate academic references to use to support your research.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as a \textbf{group}, a 15-minute summary of your research that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} each person's challenge area \textbf{and} final research question;
    		\item \textbf{debate} the most important principles based on your own research;
    		\item and \textbf{discuss how} these principles apply to working practice.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft 1000-word essay which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item  \textbf{address} the research queston;
    		\item and \textbf{analyse} which software engineering principles are the most important for your research area.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a final 1000-word essay which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\todo[inline]{\textbf{Note:} All research questions must be distinctive. Members of the same development group must \textbf{not} target the same research question.}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is an \textbf{academic writing task}. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp160-engineering}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{TeX}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Research question is appropriate and distinctive;
	\item At least six academic peer-reviewed sources are cited.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, review the challenge area announced in class. Write your proposal in the \texttt{readme.md} document and then prepare the reference list using a \texttt{*.bib} file.  Show these to your tutor.  If acceptable, this will be signed-off. 

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Research questions are adequetely addressed;
	\item Some evidence of academic rigor;
	\item Some insight into the relationship between theory and practice.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a presentation, and practice your debate and discussion. Prepare your slideshow collaboratively in TeX. Use the combined reference list of the group to broadly discuss each individual research question. Help each other. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub prior to the scheduled session. Then, attend the scheduled session.

You will receive \textbf{peer feedback} within 3 working days after the session.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare a draft version of the essay. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled session. Then, attend the scheduled session.

You will receive \textbf{peer feedback} within 3 working days after the session.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part D, revise the essay based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload the essay to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.pdf} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Developing the research question is the most challenging aspect of this assignment. It is very unlikely that you will settle on the first research question that you propose. This is because the question will often arise out of your individual research and reading efforts. Furthermore, the question should relate to working practices for game developers. An example might be: ``which design patterns are most appropriate for localising dialogue?''. You will need to discuss your question with your tutor and your peers to help focus it.

Areas where students tend to lose marks are: depth of insight; analytical skill; and evaluative skill. Depth of insight implies rigorous research, addressing one key challenge in much detail, rather than several challenges with weaker research and/or in less detail. Adequete analysis implies going beyond mere descrption, perhaps through: performing calculatons, comparing sources, or even deploying reasoning to generate new insights. Adequete evaluation implies making appropriate reference to evidence and ensuring that evidence is of appropriate quality. Further to this, sound and valid arguments are constructed, criticising the claims made by other authors.

Focus on answering your research question. You have but 1000-words! Depth over breadth. Quality over quantitiy. Write concisely. Your ability to recall facts is not under assessment, your ability to construct an argument through critical analysis and making it relevant to practice is.
