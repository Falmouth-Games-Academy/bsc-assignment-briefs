\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you will prepare a production-ready prototype of your game. This version of your game will be written in C++ and Blueprints using Unreal Engine 4. You will work with other BA and BSc students.

The success of a digital game is not just determined by the fun of its design, but also by the soundness of its architecture. Put simply, games with serious bugs do not sell. As such, the value of software engineering principles cannot be emphasised enough! Reflecting upon these principles, through the lens of a development project that mirrors industry practice, is therefore important. Further to this, there are key commercial considerations to make. Engagement with the press will need to persist throughout production, so as to ensure market interest at launch.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Launch}, as a \textbf{group}, a GitHub Pages website \textbf{and} a promotional video, which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describe} the game concept;
    		\item as well as \textbf{promote} the game's key features and aesthetics.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as a \textbf{group}, a plan which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    	    	\item \textbf{identify} the skills and time available to complete the final prototype;
    		\item \textbf{describe} the key user stories that will comprise the final prototype;
    		\item and \textbf{highlight} the stories most critical to the technical demo.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, an initial production prototype which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{illustrate} the core game mechanic;
    		\item and \textbf{apply} at least \textbf{three} non-trivial algorithms.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write}, as a \textbf{group}, a press kit for the website which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{generate} press interest in the game.
	\end{enumerate}	
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, a final production prototype which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as a \textbf{group}, an A3 research-style poster that:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{outlines and discusses} the engineering of the final prototype;
    		\item and \textbf{describes} algorithms that implemented by \textbf{EACH} member of the team. 
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as a \textbf{group}, a `technical demo' which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} the technical content of the poster;
    		\item and \textbf{showcases} the final production prototype of the game.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
  
\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{product development task}. For this project you will use the SVN repository assigned by the technical staff.

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Mostly well-formed user stories are included;
	\item User stories form a comprehensive plan;
	\item Proposed sprint has reasonable scope and is feasible.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, setup and populate the team Trello board. Ensure that all members of the team are added to the board. Show it to your product owner in the \textit{first} product owner meeting.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item The website is live;
	\item The game is adequetely described;
	\item The aesthetic is illustrated with at least four screenshots;
	\item The core game mechanics are illustrated with at least one video.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, setup GitHub Pages and populate a single web page with content. Show it to your product owner prior to the \textit{show and tell day}.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{product owner}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is formed of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item A working build is available for review;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate analysis is conducted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare a draft version of the production prototype ahead of each product owner meeting. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed into source control. Ensure that a working build is available at the start of \textit{each} sprint review.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{product owner}.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item The press kit is available online;
	\item The development team are introduced and credited for their work;
	\item Key flavour text and unique selling points are included;
	\item The aesthetic is illustrated with at least four screenshots;
	\item The core game mechanics are illustrated with at least one video.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part D, incorporate the press kit into a website. Show it to your tutor in the product owner meeting just prior to the \textit{show and tell day}.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{product owner}.


\subsection*{Part E}

Part E is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part E, revise the production prototype based on the feedback you have received and tidy up any incomplete features. Please also ensure that you include appropriate screen-shots of the Trello board in a separate folder. Then, upload the source code to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file. Please \textbf{ONLY} submit the source code, without assets, as tutors will receive a physical copy of the game from the BA students.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\subsection*{Part F}

Part F is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item \textbf{ONE} non-trivial algorithm is described
	\item Algorithm has been implemented by the person submitting the work
	\item The description of the algorithm has sufficient detail and accuracy
	\item Sufficient detail to show how the algorithm fits into the overall architecture of the game
	\item Little to no overlap with other members of the team
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part F, prepare the poster using any word processing and/or presentation tool. Then, upload the relevant files to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{informal feedback} from your tutor three days prior to Part E.

\subsection*{Part G}

Part G is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part G, look over your notes to prepare yourself to answer questions. Ensure that you are comfortable with the content of your poster and discuss any concerns with your tutor. Then, attend the scheduled technical demo session. Please ensure that you print your poster ahead of time and bring it with you. It should be printed on A3 paper and in portrait. It is your individual responsibility to check this with your colleagues. Please, also ensure that one member of the team is able to setup a laptop with the production prototype ahead of time.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\todo[inline]{\textbf{Note:} Product owners track and calculate your individual contribution to the project using the SparkPLUS system and multiple criteria which will be noted down in product owner meetings. Use the additional guidence to ensure that you are confident that you understand these criteria and what will be expected of you. You \textbf{cannot} hide behind your peers.}

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Carefully select the algorithm that you will take ownership of and implement. This algorithm will need to interface with other game components, and will therefore be affected by the constributions your peers may make to the game. Aim for high cohesion and low coupling! It is also important that the main requirements are firmly specified and are not too broad. This will ensure that there is little overlap with the work of your peers and that you do not overburden yourself with too much work. 

Please remember to commit frequently and to push your source code and related assets to the SVN repository. This will make it easier for you to maintain a backup of your work. It will also help you to measure your productivity. SVN should be an essential part of your workflow, not merely a place to archive your work. You will be expected to maintain an archive of playable builds to demo your work at any time.

Poor planning and poor time management can have a substantial impact on this assignment. As some of you may have already discovered, programming is quite unlike many of the other subjects you may have studied in that it cannot be ``crammed'' into a last minute deluge. Sustain a steady pace across the duration of the course. Do a little programming every day, if you can!

For the most part, your work will be marked as a group effort.
However, we want to avoid the situation where students try to ``coast'' through the assignment
on their fellow group members' work,
and equally the situation where one member of the group takes the lion's share of the work
and prevents the others from contributing effectively.
Marks will be weighted by a multiplier for \textbf{individual contribution},
which aims to penalise both of these behaviours.
We assess this by several means: Does their contribution in this sprint add value to the game? Has the student effectively utilised their specialist skills? Has the student effectively utilised agile and software engineering principles? Has the student demonstrated good teamworking and communication skills? Has the student checked their contribution into souce control? Any student who has contributed their \textit{fair share} of effort to the project will receive a fair \% for their effort,
so any student who is putting in the appropriate level of effort has no need to worry. Note that effort is not the same as productivity.

Your code will be assessed on \textbf{functional coherence}:
how well the finished game corresponds to the user stories,
and whether the game has any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.

Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, libraries, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for complexity  
where something simpler would have sufficed.

\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve code comprehension,
and carefully choose the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
Use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation}.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
Consider allowing some literal values, where appropriate, to be ``tinkered'' without changing the source code,
e.g.\ by defining them in an external file read by the game on startup.
