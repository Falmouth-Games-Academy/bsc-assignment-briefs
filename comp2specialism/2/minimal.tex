\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemindent}{1em}
	\item[LO3. ] \textbf{Integrate} appropriate data structures and interoperating components into software, with reference to their merits and flaws.
	\item[LO5. ] \textbf{Develop} an argument on a topic using appropriate research methods, primary and secondary sources, and academic conventions.
\end{itemize}

% \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
% 	\item \textbf{Prepare} a brief proposal which will:
% 		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
% 			\item \textbf{outline} the computing artefact you intend to create;
% 			\item \textbf{align} the computing artefact with the specialism you have chosen and its structure of worksheet activities;
% 			\item \textbf{identify} the broader context and potential application of your computing artefact;
% 			\item \textbf{describe} the work required;
% 			\item and \textbf{justify} that the computing artefact is feasible in scope.
% 		\end{enumerate}
% 	\item \textbf{Implement} a draft of your computing artefact, ensuring that you:
% 		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
% 			\item \textbf{refer} to the assignment brief that details requirements for your specific module (i.e., choice of specialism);
% 			\item and \textbf{conduct} some form of practice-based research as you implement the artefact, which you could report on.
% 		\end{enumerate}
% 	\item \textbf{Prepare} a poster that will:
% 		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
% 			\item \textbf{describe} your computing artefact;
% 			\item \textbf{illustrate} the architecture of your computing artefact;
% 			\item and \textbf{justify} key development choices and design decisions.
% 		\end{enumerate}
% 	\item \textbf{Present}, as an individual, the poster:
% 		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
% 			\item \textbf{articulating} your key design decisions \textbf{and} approaches to developing your computing artefact;
% 			\item \textbf{analysing} the merits and flaws of these decisions and approaches;
% 			\item as well as \textbf{explaining} your practice-based research.
% 		\end{enumerate}
% 	\item \textbf{Prepare} a report as a web page that will:
% 		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
% 			\item \textbf{describe} your computing artefact;
% 			\item \textbf{illustrate} the architecture of your computing artefact;
% 			\item \textbf{embed} a video of your computing artefact;
% 			\item \textbf{communicate} your practice-based research;
% 			\item and \textbf{defend} an argument related to the outcome of this research.
% 		\end{enumerate}		
% 	\item \textbf{Present}, as an individual, the web page to your tutor, ensuring that you:
% 		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
% 			\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
% 			\item as well as \textbf{showcase} your knowledge of system architecture/research.
