\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
``A good portfolio is essential for getting your first role in the games industry, and not just for artists! You will be expected to show examples of your work when applying for roles at a games studio, whether youâ€™re a game artist, programmer, designer, or any other dev role!'\thinspace''

    Poster demonstrations are a common way of presenting computing projects and will help
    you to develop communication skills which are useful in interview contexts, especially when
    showcasing your portfolio work to potential employers.
}

For this assignment, you will create and present a technical poster and orally report the outcome of practice-based research related to the technical architecture of your individual specialist computing project.

Whether you are going to apply for a role in the industry or for a role further afield, employers will want to know what you can do and what value will you bring
to their company. People care more about concrete practical examples of your work experience and your skills, and so it is important to develop a comfort with demonstrating
and discussing technical projects. Hence, this `technical report' assignment is framed around how you communicate a potential portfolio piece to an employer.
 
There are \textbf{TWO} key learning outcomes which you need to address in your technical report. These are:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemindent}{1em}
	\item[LO3. ] \textbf{Integrate} appropriate data structures and interoperating components into computing systems, with reference to their merits and flaws.
	\item[LO5. ] \textbf{Develop} an argument on a topic using appropriate research methods, primary and secondary sources, and academic conventions.
\end{itemize}

As such, there needs to be an element of reflection in your technical report where you analyse the merits and flaws of the architecture of your computing artefact. There also needs to be an element of research in which you develop an \textit{argument}. By argument,
we mean ``an evidence-based defence of a non-obvious position on a complex issue''. This is \textbf{not} a traditional academic essay, and so please do not take a formal approach and do not restrict yourself to academic sources. Though you still need to follow academic conventions, it is not a literature review! Citing the grey literature is not only acceptable but is encouraged. The best way of achieving both of these learning outcomes is through practice-based research. This means we anticipate that you conduct ``an original investigation in order to gain new knowledge by means of practice and the outcomes of that practice''. Typically, tinkering with your artefact, experimenting with ways of doing things, and comparing outcomes.

This assignment is directly linked to the `computing artefact' assignment in the specialist module that you have selected. You should report on practice-based research associated with your artefact. Accordingly, the assignment is formed of these parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Prepare} a brief proposal which will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{outline} the computing artefact you intend to create;
			\item \textbf{align} the computing artefact with the specialism you have chosen and its structure of worksheet activities;
			\item \textbf{identify} the broader context and potential application of your computing artefact;
			\item \textbf{describe} the work required;
			\item and \textbf{justify} that the computing artefact is feasible in scope.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Describe} your progress to your supervisor, ensuring that you:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{refer} to the assignment brief that details requirements for your specific module (i.e., choice of specialism);
			\item and \textbf{conduct} some form of practice-based research as you implement the artefact, which you could report on.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Prepare} a poster that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{describe} your computing artefact;
			\item \textbf{illustrate} the architecture of your computing artefact;
			\item and \textbf{justify} key development choices and design decisions.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Present}, as an individual, the poster:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{articulating} your key design decisions \textbf{and} approaches to developing your computing artefact;
			\item \textbf{analysing} the merits and flaws of these decisions and approaches;
			\item as well as \textbf{explaining} your practice-based research.
		\end{enumerate}	
\end{enumerate}

You should discuss what constitutes appropriate practice-based research with your supervisor. An example of practice-based research that you could report on is experimenting with and comparing different solutions and techniques. See:

\end{sloppypar}

This will vary by area of specialism. You will meet with your tutor in timetabled sessions to support this aspect of your individual specialist computing project.

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{reporting} task. There is no template repository for this assignment; but, you may create one if you wish. You can use any editor of your choice, but you are expected to produce a \textbf{.pdf} of your poster for submission.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. Answer the following questions to pass:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the high concept of your computing artefact?
	\item What functionality will your component include?
	\item How does your artefact fit into your chosen specialism?
	\item Why is this artefact needed?
	\item What are the key requirements?
	\item Is the scope appropriate for the development time available?
	\item How will you address the architect and research requirement?
\end{itemize}

To complete Part A, prepare notes using any word processing tool. Your notes may include images and/or links to online videos.

Show your notes to your \textbf{tutor} in the timetabled proposal review session in Week 2 for immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item The computing artefact fits within the scope of the chosen specialism;
	\item The computing artefact is appropriate according to the constraints in the assignment brief for the chosen specialism;
	\item There is sufficient original computing content to be developed to deliver proposed computing artefact (i.e., it is non-trivial);
	\item The proposed computing artefact can serve as a platform for practice-based research;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a draft version of your computing component. Ensure that you refer to the specific assignment brief for your choice of module.
Bring the artefact to the supervision session in Week 5 and the mid-term review session in Week 6. Ensure that you use version control for your work, but in the event of problems, screen sharing and images are acceptable.

Please make clear those parts of the project constitute your component for this assignment.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.  The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item The poster follows the required template  (i.e., is a portrait A3 document with all specified sections);
	\item There is identifying information on the poster (i.e., your name and the project title);
	\item There is at least one UML diagram;
	\item The poster clearly illustrates the key system components, patterns, and/or data structures;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, produce an A3 portrait poster. You may use any software to prepare the poster, but you should follow the layout in the provided \textbf{Powerpoint} template.  Bring the digital version of the poster to the supervision session in Week 8.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis.  Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

Update the poster based on the feedback that you received in Part C. Then, upload to \texttt{LearningSpace} by the time/date specified in the list of deadlines available on \href{http://myfalmouth.falmouth.ac.uk}{MyFalmouth}. You only need to submit the poster itself. Please note that you should upload the video of your artefact to the appropriate submission queue for the `computing artefact` assignment and \textbf{not} the submission queue for the technical report. 

Then, attend the timetabled viva session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} in the viva.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{module leader} in three weeks.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

It is important to keep up with the formative deadlines as receiving and then
acting on the feedback will not only enable you to achieve a high grade, it
will enable you to make a better project.

When it comes to the poster, you should endeavour to limit the amount of text,
you always should favour images over text. If you use text, please ensure the
font size is legible on the printed out poster.
