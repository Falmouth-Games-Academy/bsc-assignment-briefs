\section*{Introduction}

In this worksheet you are going to build in the work completed in Worksheet A. In this worksheet you will be building up a basic scene which will involve loading and rendering a few 3D models, these models should have some texturing. There should be some form of interactivity which will allow the user to navigate the scene.

To complete this worksheet, build an application which implements the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Loading} of 3D Models
	\item \textbf{Placement} of 3D Objects in the scene
	\item \textbf{Loading} of Textures
	\item \textbf{Rendering} of Objects with basic shaders
	\item \textbf{First Person Controls} using keyboard and mouse
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Submission instructions}

Continue using the repository from Worksheet A, you should consider creating a new branch for this worksheet

You should complete a pull request before the hand-in on Friday by 5pm on Week 7. Feedback will be given in the pull request and in class.

\section*{Marking criteria}

Remember that \textbf{it is better to submit incomplete work than to submit nothing at all}. If you do not manage to finish all assigned task, then you can complete this before the submission of Worksheet B

To demonstrate \textbf{basic competency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Loading of 3D Models
	\item Placement of 3D Models
	\item Rendering of objects
\end{itemize} 

To demonstrate \textbf{basic proficiency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{basic competency}
	\item Loading of Textures
\end{itemize}

To demonstrate \textbf{novice competency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{basic proficiency}
	\item Keyboard and mouse controls
\end{itemize}

To demonstrate \textbf{novice proficiency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{novice competency}
	\item Some evidence of software design
	\item Some evidence of reusability (functions, classes, inheritance) 
	\item Additional joypad controls
\end{itemize}

To demonstrate \textbf{professional competency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{novice proficiency}
	\item Evidence of good software design (unit tests, static code analysis)
	\item Evidence of reusability (Framework is compiled into a library and can be reused)
\end{itemize}
