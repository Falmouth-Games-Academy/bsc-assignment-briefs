\section*{Introduction}

In this worksheet, you will implement a set of AI behaviours for the enemies in a simple game.

Begin by \textbf{forking} one of the following git repositories:

This repositories contain a  project based on the classic arcade game \emph{Pac-Man}.
The player uses the WASD keys to run around a maze collecting pills.
The maze is also inhabited by four ghosts:
these will kill the player upon contact, unless a power pill is active, in which case the player kills the ghost.
In the template project, the ghosts (implemented in the \texttt{GhostCharacter} class) stay still in the centre of the maze;
your task for this worksheet is to implement suitable AI behaviours.

\end{center}

To complete this worksheet:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Fork} the repository linked above.
	\item \textbf{Implement} a basic Behaviour Tree based AI controller for the ghosts.
		A good starting tutorial is available at \url{https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Blueprint\_Behavior\_Tree\_Tutorial}, Unity users should refer to the tutorial mentioned in the comments and the lecture slides.
	\item \textbf{Iterate} on your AI to produce suitably complex and engaging behaviours.
	%\item \textbf{Open a pull request} by 22nd November 2019 to receive formative feedback.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Additional guidance}

In many genres of game, the design of AI agents is key to delivering a good player experience.
It would be easy to create virtually unbeatable ghost AI for Pac-Man,
however this would not lead to enjoyable gameplay.

The following are some ideas for how you might make your solution more interesting (all of these are optional suggestions):

\subsection*{Unreal}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Give each of the ghosts its own distinctive behaviour. (Note that if you choose to subclass \texttt{GhostCharacter} to allow for this,
	you can edit the \texttt{GhostSpawner}s in the level to cause them to spawn instances of your new class.)
	\item Have the ghosts behave differently based on whether a power pill is active.
	\item Give the ghosts limited perception so that they have to find the player.
	\item Have the ghosts take the state of the game, e.g.\ locations of pills left, into account.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Unity}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Give each of the ghosts its own distinctive behaviour. (Note that if you choose to modify \texttt{BtController} to allow for this - for example, swapping the tree based on the name of the agent).
	\item Have the ghosts behave differently based on whether a power pill is active.
	\item Give the ghosts limited perception so that they have to find the player.
	\item Have the ghosts take the state of the game, e.g.\ locations of pills left, into account.
\end{itemize}
