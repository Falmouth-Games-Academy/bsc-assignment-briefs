\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
``No matter the language, learning to program will take a very long time, and is often very frustrating. I'm sorry. There is no solution. Just practice. Regular practice.

To complete this worksheet, you are expected to rapid prototype a simple User Interface in Unreal Engine. Once complete, the interface will be subject to a heuristic evaluation by a peer. In return, you will evaluate someone else's interface design. To fulfil the requirements of this worksheet you are expected to submit evidence of the entire process in the form of one Unreal Engine project hosting the interface, screenshots of the interface, and the results from both heuristic evaluations in pdf format. 

To complete this worksheet: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item \textbf{Design} \& {implement} a simple UI in Unreal Engine;
    \item \textbf{Designate} a peer to evaluate your user interface design;
    \item \textbf{Evaluate} the user interface design of a peer
    \item \textbf{Summarise} the improvements that could be made to your user interface design based on the results of the heuristic evaluation. 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
			Each worksheet has its own formative deadline, specified on that worksheet and also communicated in class.
    		Falmouth University policy states that summative deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub. 
    		
	\item 	\textbf{How will I receive feedback on my work?} \\ 
    		You will be given verbal feedback on your work during the session in which it is marked.
    		If you require more in-depth feedback or discussion, please book an appointment with your tutor.
    		
    	\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\ 	
    		If you have discovered an issue with the brief itself, the source files are available at: \\
