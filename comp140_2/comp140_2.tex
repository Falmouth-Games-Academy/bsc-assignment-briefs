\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you are required to design and implement a component for a game.
The component must be based on one or more \textbf{existing third-party APIs}:
for example web services, hardware device SDKs, open-source libraries, or open dataset formats.
Your component must be integrated into either:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item A game developed by \textbf{BA Digital Games} students (liaise with your chosen BA team before choosing this option); or
    \item Your \textbf{COMP130} Kivy game project; or
    \item Your \textbf{COMP150} group game project (\textbf{limit one per team}: liaise with the rest of your team before choosing this option); or
    \item \label{item:game-opensource} An \textbf{open-source game}; or
    \item \label{item:game-mod} A \textbf{commercial game} which has a well-established (official or community-made) modding interface that allows mods to be developed in one of the permitted languages.
\end{enumerate}
Whichever option you choose, you may implement your component in \textbf{C++}, \textbf{C\#}, \textbf{Python}, or a combination of these.
Other languages may be permitted at the discretion of your tutor, if you can argue convincingly that it is appropriate for your proposed project.
Note that options~\ref{item:game-opensource} and~\ref{item:game-mod} above are likely to be more technically challenging than the others,
so are recommended only for those comfortable with advanced programming concepts.

You may work \textbf{individually} or \textbf{in pairs}.
This project is assessed individually, so ensure that \textbf{your individual contribution is clearly indicated}.

This assignment is formed of \textbf{three} parts.
There is a \textbf{single summative submission} via LearningSpace.
Begin by forking the GitHub project at the following URL:
\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp140-api-hacking}
\end{center}

\subsection*{A. \emph{Propose} a game component}

On GitHub, edit the \texttt{readme.md} file to contain a description of your proposed game component.
Your proposal should:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Identify} the game into which your component will be integrated;
    \item \textbf{Describe} the component that will be created;
    \item \textbf{Show} the key user stories, in the form of a Trello task board;
    \item \textbf{Identify and justify} which technologies (implementation language, APIs, etc.) you will use.
\end{itemize}
Your proposal will be assessed on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scope}:
        is the proposed component non-trivial, but feasible given the duration of the project?
    \item \textbf{Appropriateness of component}:
        will the proposed component enhance the selected game?
    \item \textbf{Appropriateness of technologies}:
        is the choice of implementation language and APIs sensible and well-justified?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Formative submission:} Discuss your proposal and task board with tutors in class.

\subsection*{B. \emph{Implement} the component}

You will build your prototype component over \textbf{three sprints}.
At the beginning of each sprint, populate the sprint backlog on your Trello board.
You should aim to have a `potentially shippable' component at the end of each sprint;
that is, a component which does not have any major flaws or half-finished features that prevent it from being tested.
For the first two sprints, the component should be working either within the game or in a separate testing environment;
for the final sprint, the component should be fully integrated into the game.

Your implementation will be assessed on the criteria listed in the marking rubric.

\textbf{Formative submission:} Participate in the sprint review sessions in class.
Check your code into GitHub regularly (either your forked \texttt{comp140-api-hacking} repository or a branch of another appropriate repository),
and make a pull request whenever you require assistance or feedback.

\subsection*{C. \emph{Demonstrate} your component}

Bring an executable of the game, with your component integrated, to the demo session in class.
Be prepared to discuss it with tutors and peers.

This part is not assessed, but you will receive feedback which will be useful to you on future projects.

\textbf{Formative submission:} Participate in the demo session.

\subsection*{Summative submission (electronic)}

Create a zip file containing the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A markdown file named \texttt{readme.md} containing your \textbf{proposal} from part~A,
    and any other \textbf{documentation} you feel is appropriate
    (e.g.\ special instructions for testing the component).
\item Screenshots of your \textbf{Trello task board}.
    As a minimum, include one from the beginning and one from the end of each sprint,
    and screenshots documenting any checklists or other information within your cards.
\item All \textbf{source code} created for part~B.
    You do \textbf{not} need to provide the entire source code for the game.
    Any code which was \textbf{not written by you} must be \textbf{clearly identified} as such,
    in the \texttt{readme.md} file and/or as comments in the code files themselves.
\item A \textbf{Windows executable} version of the game with your component integrated.
    Or, in the case of a mod for a commercial game, an executable version of the mod with clear installation instructions.
    \textbf{Do not include copyright material which you do not have permission to redistribute}.
\end{itemize}

The recommended way to produce this zip file is to check all of the above into your GitHub repository
throughout the course of the project,
and then use the ``Download Zip'' function on the GitHub website.
Any material you do not wish to upload to GitHub (e.g.\ the executable)
must be added to the zip file manually before uploading.

Upload your zip file to the appropriate submission queue on LearningSpace.
Note that LearningSpace accepts only a single zip file per submission,
with a maximum file size of 1GB.
If the game executable is larger than this, contact your tutors to make alternative arrangements.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Creating new software solutions from scratch is an important skill for software developers.
However it can lead to ``reinventing the wheel'': spending much time and effort solving problems which have already been solved by others.
Thus an equally important skill is being able to bring together existing code from different sources to produce a cohesive whole.
Ensure that your \textbf{choice of technologies} is appropriate.
%Your choice of implementation language may be somewhat constrained:
%for example a component for a Unity game will need to be implemented in C\#, or in C++ using Unity's native plugin interface.
%Depending on your proposed component, you may have a wider choice in terms of which API or APIs you use.
Read up on the alternatives to determine which is the best fit for your proposed component.

Falmouth University is nationally and internationally renowned as an arts institution.
Despite the fact that you are studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in a technical discipline,
you are still expected to strive for the same level of \textbf{innovation and creative flair}
as your fellow students in other departments.
All assignments on this course involve a mix of technical and creative activities;
cultivating both of these skills in tandem will stand you in good stead for a career in the games industry.
One approach to promoting creativity is
\textbf{divergent thinking}: generation of ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
Often the most interesting ideas are \textbf{subversive}: they deliberately go against the
conventional or most obvious solution.

The first step in planning your implementation should be to break your proposed component down into \textbf{user stories}. 
Your user stories should be \textbf{distinguishable} (i.e.\ there should be little overlap between them)
and \textbf{easily measured} (i.e.\ it should be easy to tell when each user story has been implemented).
They should also be \textbf{comprehensive}, i.e.\ the user stories should completely capture the
desired functionality of the component, with no gaps.
Your code will be assessed on \textbf{functional coherence}:
how well the finished component corresponds to the user stories,
and whether there are any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.

Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, library features, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key, however:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for shoehorning a complicated solution into your program
where a simpler one would have sufficed.

\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve comprehension of your code,
and choose carefully the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
For high marks you should use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation} of your files, classes and functions.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
%Consider allowing some literal values, where appropriate, to be ``tinkered'' without changing the source code,
%e.g.\ by defining them in an external file read by the game on startup.
