\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you are required to propose and write a game component for an existing game.
You may target one of the games being developed by BA Digital Games students, or your own game
from your COMP150 group project or COMP130 app development project.
You will then present a demonstration of your work.

Games are often comprised of a rich architecture incorporating many components. As such, coding tasks in the games industry may require you to develop bespoke code on a particular aspect of a game. Examples include: level generators; event triggers; conflict mechanics; character behaviours; physics; and so on. Through this project, you will become acquainted with techniques and methods that help you to work effectively to write such components; thereby, gaining knowledge of coding and its various aspects.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a brief proposal that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{identify} a component of game architecture;
    		\item \textbf{describe} what will be created;
    		\item \textbf{illustrate} the key user stories;
    		\item and \textbf{identify} the existing game the component will integrate into;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft computer program that will:
        	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{implement} the game component;
    		\item and \textbf{address} the requirements highlighted in the proposal;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a final computer program that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor or your peers;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present} a research-style poster \textbf{and} an executable version of your final program.
\end{enumerate}

\todo[inline]{\textbf{Note:} All submissions must be clearly distinctive. Members of the same development group must \textbf{not} target the same component.}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{programming task} and so regular pushes to a GitHub repository are expected. \textbf{Either} fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp110-coding-task-2}

\textbf{Or}, create a branch in an existing repository. Ensure the branch is not deleted upon merge. Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for either \textbf{Python} or \textbf{Visual Studio} depending on which programming environment you wish to use for this assignment. Please, also ensure that you add IDE-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

%You may use pull requests to seek additional feedback and support from the community at Falmouth University Games Academy.

Setup a Trello board to manage this assignment. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Proposed game component is relevant to the existing game;
	\item Coding task is non-trivial and achievable.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, write your proposal in the \texttt{readme.md} document and add user stories to the backlog of the Trello board. Show these to your tutor.  If acceptable, this will be signed-off. 

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a draft version of the source code for your game component. This may or may not be integrated into the existing game. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled code review session. Then, attend the scheduled code review session.

You will receive \textbf{peer feedback} within 3 working days after the review session.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. The following criteria are used to allocate marks:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Appropriateness of Requirements;
	\item Appropriateness of Design;
	\item Functional Coherence of Executable Solution;
	\item Maintainability of Source Code;
	\item Sophistication of Source Code;
	\item Professional Practice.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, revise the source code for your game component based on the feedback you have received. Integrate your source code into the existing game. Then, upload the source code and related assets to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file, and will not accept any other compression formats.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item The poster describes the component appropriately;
	\item The coding task is demonstrated with a working executable.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part D, firstly prepare executable demo of your game component. Secondly, prepare a research-style poster that describes your component. This poster should be A3 in portrait format. Then, attend the scheduled demo session. Ensure that the poster (in \texttt{*.pdf} format) and executable have been pushed to GitHub prior to this session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Do not begin programming the game component until your tutor has reviewed your proposal. It is important that the main requirements are firmly specified and are not too broad. This will help ensure that you do not overburden yourself with too much work. 

Please remember to commit frequently and to push your source code and related assets to the GitHub repository. This will make it easier for you to maintain a backup of your work. It will also help you to measure your productivity. GitHub should be an essential part of your workflow, not merely a place to submit your work for feedback.

Poor planning and poor time management can have a significant impact on this assignment.
%It is very easy to underestimate how much work is involved in first learning programming concepts and then actually applying them in order to write a computer program.
As some of you may have already discovered, programming is quite unlike other subjects in that it cannot be ``crammed'' into a last minute deluge. Sustain a steady pace across the duration of the course. Do a little programming every day, if you can!

In order to obtain higher marks, you are being expected to focus on the \textbf{quality} of your code, rather than just its functionality. Pay specific attention to \textbf{maintainability} (formatting, naming, comments, etc.) and \textbf{sophistication} (appropriate use of language constructs, data structures, algorithms, design patterns, etc.). This can be supported through disciplined working practices. Such practice may include regular peer review. It may also include the use of ``lint'' code analysis tools and reference to style guidelines.

If you encounter difficulty, please email your tutor for support. For problems relating specifically to source code, please make a pull request on GitHub.
