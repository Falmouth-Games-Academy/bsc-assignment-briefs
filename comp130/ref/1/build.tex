    When you have only a hammer, many problems will look like a nail. Ensure that you broaden your knowledge of engineering so you have a wide repetoir of software development skills that you can apply to a variety of different problems.

}

In this assignment, you will research software engineering principles to bring an academic perspective to your working practice. Specifically, exploring: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item One prolific engineering challenge related to game development;
    \item and how relevant engineering principles apply to your COMP130 project.
\end{enumerate}

Working practices are important to employers in the games industry. Problems arising from poor software design and ineffective quality assurance practices are very expensive and largely avoidable. As such, key software engineering principles are widely used in the games industry. They are essential to learn. Additionally, research skills will help you with your professional development. Most critically, moving beyond textbooks and websites to the academic literature, which will help you to keep your skills up to date in the future.

In this assignment you will submit an essay which contains the following

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 2000-word essay which will \textbf{address} the engineering challenge raised by your research queston; and \textbf{justify} those software engineering principles which should be leveraged in your working practice to overcome the challenge. 
	\item At least \textbf{8} academic references to use to support your research.
\end{enumerate}


\todo[inline]{\textbf{Note:} All research questions must be distinctive. Members of the same development group must \textbf{not} target the same field or question.}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is an \textbf{academic writing task}. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp130-software-engineering}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{TeX}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Submission Instruction}

To complete the assignment, upload the essay to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.pdf} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Developing the research question is, by far, the most challenging aspect of this assignment. It is very unlikely that you will settle on the first research question that you propose. This is because the question will often arise out of your individual research and reading efforts. Furthermore, the question should relate to challenges that game developers encounter and the working practices they could adopt to overcome such challenges. 

Carefully consider the structure and forumulation of your research question. The question should be framed in such a way that it makes it easy for you to produce a recommendation based on critical argument. There are three key components that you need to consider to enable the question to facilitate the making of such a recommendation. These are: an area of challenge; a specific game system or area of application within game or game engine architecture; and a single relevant engineering principle and/or technique. An example might be: ``which design patterns is the most appropriate for localising dialogue?''. Here, the challenge is localisation. The specific game system is dialogue. The software engineering aspect is the application of design patterns. This question will hopefully also motivate an analysis as it asks ``which is \textit{most} appropriate''. You will need to discuss your question with your tutor and your peers to help focus it.

Challenge areas include: accessibility; portability; internationalisation; and verification. Application areas are numerous, but popular choices have included: player interactions; feedback to players; artifically intelligent agents; procedural content generation of levels; collision detection; and many others. Areas of software engineering might include: empirical approaches; metrics; design patterns; CASE tools; test-driven development; continuous integration; novel data structures; choice of programming paradigm (e.g., object-orientated vs data-driven); structured methods for quality assurance; and so on.

It is critically important that submissions focus on a problem, motivate it with examples of how it affects games/players, and present a suitable solution. \textbf{It is not enough to merely discuss the importance of a problem or the general usefulness of a working practice!} Essays must focus on a specific challenge and make a concrete recommendation on how to overcome that challenge. An essay that merely emphasises the importance of an issue or the significance of a challenge, or how difficult it is to apply a particular technique will likely fail. Additionally, the work \textbf{must be technical in nature and be relevant to software engineering}. Questions about generic project management issues such as human resource management or game design practices such as play testing will be rejected.

Areas where students tend to lose marks are: depth of insight; analytical skill; and evaluative skill. Depth of insight implies rigorous research, addressing one key challenge in much detail, rather than several challenges with weaker research and/or in less detail. Adequete analysis implies going beyond mere descrption, perhaps through: performing calculatons, comparing sources, or even deploying reasoning to generate new insights. Adequete evaluation implies making appropriate reference to evidence and ensuring that evidence is of appropriate quality. Further to this, sound and valid arguments are constructed, criticising the claims made by other authors.

Focus on answering your research question. You have but 2000-words! Depth over breadth. Quality over quantitiy. Write concisely. Your ability to recall facts is not under assessment, your ability to construct an argument through critical analysis, make it relevant to practice, and justify a recommendation, is!
