\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you will prepare a playable early-access game. Your game will be written in \textit{C++} using \textit{Unreal Engine 4}. You will work collaboratively in a multi-disciplinary team with other BA and BSc students.

The success of a digital game is not just determined by the fun of its design, but also by the soundness of its architecture. Put simply, games with serious bugs do not sell. As such, the value of software engineering principles cannot be emphasised enough! Reflecting upon these principles, using the lens of a development process that mirrors industry practice, is therefore critically important. Further to this, there are key quality assurance techniques and anlysis methods to appy. This will be an ongoing process, so engagement will need to persist throughout the production cycle.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Launch}, as a \textbf{group}, a GitHub Pages website \textbf{and} promotional video, which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describe} the game concept;
    		\item as well as \textbf{showcase} the game's unique selling points and aesthetics.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as an \textbf{individual}, a draft A3 poster which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    	    	\item \textbf{identify ONE} component for which \textbf{you} are individually accountable;
    		\item \textbf{describe} its requirements \textbf{and} design using UML;
    		\item and \textbf{highlight} the deliverables for the `technical demo'.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, a playable game prototype which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item be a stand-alone executable suitable for play-testing;
    		\item and \textbf{illustrate} the core game mechanic.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write}, as an \textbf{individual}, a blog post for the GitHub Pages site which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
			\item \textbf{describe} the architecture and engineering of the game;
    		\item \textbf{analyse} the engineering quality of the game \textbf{and your} component.
	\end{enumerate}	
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, an early-access release canditate which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as an \textbf{individual}, a final A3 research-style poster that:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{analyses} the architectural and engineering qualities of the early-access release canditate;
    		\item and \textbf{describes} the component \textbf{you} implemented using pseudocode, code snippets, UML, \textbf{and} software quality metrics. 
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as a \textbf{group}, a `technical demo' which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} the technical content of \textbf{EACH} poster;
    		\item and \textbf{showcase} the early-access release canditate of the game.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
  
\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{product development task}. For this project you \textbf{MUST} use the version control repository allocated to your team.

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories and branches. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item The website is live;
	\item The game is adequetely described;
	\item The unique selling points are clearly listed;
	\item The aesthetic is illustrated with at least four screenshots;
	\item The core game mechanics are showcased through a video.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, setup GitHub Pages and populate a single web page with information about the game and the promptional video. Show it to your product owner by the end of the first sprint.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{product owner}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item An appropriate game component is adequetely described;
	\item A UML use-case diagram is used to describe the requirements; 
	\item A UML class diagram is used to describe the design.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a draft version of the poster. Submit the poster, in \texttt{.pdf} format, to the peer-review activity in the appropriate session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{peers} and \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is formed of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item A working build is available at \textbf{EACH} review;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare a build of the master branch ahead of \textbf{EACH} sprint review meeting. Ensure that the source code and assets have been merged. Showcase these builds at \textbf{EACH} sprint review meeting.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{product owner}.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D consists of a \textbf{single summative} submission. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part D, analyse the engineering quality of the game overall and the invididual component. Incorporate the findings into the GitHub pages site. Ensure that you include appropriate diagrams and quantitative analyses. Upload the relevant pages from the blog to the LearningSpace. Please note the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file. 

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the deadline.

\subsection*{Part E}

Part E is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part E, revise the prototype based on the  feedback you have received and tidy away any incomplete features. Build the project and copy it to a USB storage device. Please note, you \textbf{MUST} include \textbf{BOTH} the source code \textbf{and} a stand-alone playable build. These should be in two separate and clearly labelled folders. Then, submit it physically alongside your colleagues on the other courses.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\subsection*{Part F}

Part F is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part F, prepare the poster using any word processing and/or presentation tool. Then, upload the relevant files to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\subsection*{Part G}

Part G is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item All members of the team are present at the `technical demo';
		\item A working \textbf{and} playable early-access release canditate is showcased;
	\item Overall, analyses of engineering quality are sufficient \textbf{and} accurate.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part G, prepare for the poster demo. Endeavour to ensure that you are comfortable discussing the content of your poster and are able to answer technical questions. Then, attend the scheduled `technical demo' session. Please ensure that you print your poster ahead of time and bring it with you. It should be printed on A3 paper and in portrait. It is your individual responsibility to do this. Please, also ensure that one member of the team is able to setup a demo of the early-access release canditate and any  equipment that you may need ahead of time.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from \textbf{attending staff}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

This is a complex and challenging project. It is double-weighted in terms of module credits and so is worth a substantial proportion of your overall marks. There are \textbf{THREE} main deliverables. These are:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Your blog posts, which review your key contributions and their engineering quality, submitted online as an invidual to the LearningSpace;
		\item A working and playable build of the early-acces release canditate, submitted physically as a group on a USB device;
	\item and, a poster highlighting \textbf{ONE} game component that you assumed responsibility for, submitted online as an invidual to the LearningSpace.
\end{enumerate}

Carefully select the algorithms and/or components that you take ownership of and implement. These will not only need to interface with other game components, but also other kinds of contributions made by artistic colleagues. Aim for high cohesion and low coupling! Firmly specify the requirements and ensure they are not too broad. This will help you to avoid overlap with the work of your peers and overburdening yourself with too much work. 

Please remember to commit frequently and to push your source code and related assets to the repository. This will make it easier for you to maintain a backup of your work. It will also help you to measure your productivity. Version control \textbf{MUST} be a core and essential part of your workflow, not merely a place to archive your work. You will be expected to maintain an archive of playable builds to demo your work at any time.

Poor planning and poor time management can have a substantial impact on this assignment. As some of you may have already discovered, programming is quite unlike many of the other subjects you may have studied in that it cannot be ``crammed'' into a last minute deluge. Sustain a steady pace across the duration of the course. Do a little programming every day, if you can!

For the most part, your work will be marked as a group effort.
However, we want to avoid the situation where students try to ``coast'' through the assignment
on their fellow group members' work,
and equally the situation where one member of the group takes the lion's share of the work
and prevents the others from contributing effectively.
Marks will be weighted by a multiplier for \textbf{individual contribution},
which aims to penalise both of these behaviours.
We assess this by several means: Does their contribution in this sprint add value to the game? Has the student effectively utilised their specialist skills? Has the student effectively utilised agile and software engineering principles? Has the student demonstrated good teamworking and communication skills? Has the student checked their contribution into souce control? Any student who has contributed their \textit{fair share} of effort to the project will receive a fair \% for their effort,
so any student who is putting in the appropriate level of effort has no need to worry. Note that effort is not the same as productivity.

\todo[inline]{\textbf{Note:} In addition to sprint retrospectives and peer-review activities, your product owners will track your individual contributions using your GitHub Pages blog, the version control system, and reports generated by SparkPLUS---alongside other criteria, as described above, which they will note down in product owner meetings.}

You are expected to act professionally with respect to this project. Most notably, it is \textbf{mandatory} for the team to arrange a daily stand-up meeting and it is \textbf{mandatory} for every member of the team to attend. This should be maintained every weekday throughout the duration of the project, including the studio period and days when you have sessions. 

It is also \textbf{mandatory} to attend every single meeting with your product owner. Your attendence to these meetings will be monitored. If you cannot attend a meeting, you \textbf{MUST} send a email in advance to your product owner. This should detail your apologies just as if you were emailing a senior colleague or manager in a real business context. You will be penalised on your individual contribution multiplier for any unauthorised absences. 

Now that you are working in larger, multi-disciplinary teams, you will encounter collaborative complexity. There will be many more lines of communication, and therefore greater opportunity for disorganisation and conflict. Likewise, some members of the team may become agitated if others appear to be less productive than they should be. Whatever forms that these may take, it is important that you recognise such challenges and approach them in a collegiate and constructive manner. It is \textit{critically important} that you maintain your professionalism. Be helpful and understanding. Your criticisms should be a gift to help your peers grow, improve, and mature. This means that concerns should relate to directly to working practice (or lack thereof) and be reasonably actionable. When raised, the discussion should be fair and tolerate the possibility of a compromise, as well as the your potential involvement in providing direct support for your peer.    

As adults, in the first instance, you should resolve these challenges yourself. Do not permit them to fester and stagnate. Tackle these head-on at the earliest opportunity. However, if there is a breach of professional conduct, contact your product owner.
