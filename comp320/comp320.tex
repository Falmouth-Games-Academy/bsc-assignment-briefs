You are required to deliver a major \textbf{research project} as part of your degree; either in the form of \textbf{empirical research} relating to computing for games, or \textbf{practice-based research} related to game development. Individually, you explore a field that interests you, and for which there is a clearly identified need. This module forms the first part of this project and provides the opportunity to conduct a literature review, as well as to collect and analyse data using appropriate methods and statistics.

This module is formed of \textbf{two} assignments:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Produce} a prototype research artefact that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{facilitate} the collection of empirical data for your project
			\item \textbf{demonstrate} the technical feasibility of your proposed artefact
			\item \textbf{provide} a basis for further development and experimentation in the second study block
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Write} a research review and proposal that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{identify} and \textbf{analyse} the scientific literature relevant to your project
			\item \textbf{propose} the research question(s) for your project
			\item \textbf{justify} your choice of research question(s)
			\item \textbf{outline} and \textbf{justify} the methodology to be used in addressing the research question(s)
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

These assignments are a \textbf{research} task, consisting of \textbf{academic reading}, \textbf{academic writing},
\textbf{software development} and \textbf{scientific experimentation}.

For the \textbf{prototype research artefact}, there is no set GitHub repository.
However you are strongly encouraged to create one.
Ensure that you set up the \texttt{.gitignore} file for your chosen development environment,
and maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

For the \textbf{research review and proposal}, fork the GitHub repository at the following URLs:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp320-proposal}

Use the existing LaTeX template, which is based on the IEEE Transactions style,
to write your literature review and proposal.

\subsection*{Assignment 1: Prototype Research Artefact}

Assignment 1 consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}.
However your project supervisor may also set summative deadlines at their discretion.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{holistic} basis,
according to the descriptors set out at the end of this document.

To complete Assignment 1, design and implement a piece of research software appropriate to your chosen project.
Create a Trello board setting out the key requirements for the software,
and identifying which requirements will be tackled this study block
and which are stretch goals to be left until later.
Check the source code into a version control repository regularly.
Ensure your \texttt{readme.md} file contains any information required to build and run the artefact, if appropriate.

Upload a \texttt{.zip} file containing your source code, associated assets, and screenshots of your Trello board to the LearningSpace.
Note that LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive immediate and continuous \textbf{informal feedback} through meetings with your supervisor.
You will also receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the formative deadline.

\subsection*{Assignment 2: Prototype Research Artefact}

Assignment 2 consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}.
However your project supervisor may also set summative deadlines at their discretion.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{holistic} basis,
according to the descriptors set out at the end of this document.

To complete Assignment 2, use the provided LaTeX template to write a literature review and proposal.
Do \textbf{not} modify the formatting of the provided template.
Your document must not exceed \textbf{six pages} of text,
excluding figures, tables, references and appendices.

Upload your final \texttt{.pdf} file to the LearningSpace.
Note that LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.pdf} file.

You will receive immediate and continuous \textbf{informal feedback} through meetings with your supervisor.
You will also receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the formative deadline.

\section*{Appendix: British Computer Society Requirements}

An individual project is an expectation within undergraduate, integrated masters, and postgraduate masters programmes in computing. Students must be provided with written guidance on all aspects of the project, including selection,conduct, supervision, milestones, format of the report and the criteria for assessment. All projects should reflect the aims and learning outcomes which characterise the programme to which they contribute as set out in the programme specification.

It is expected that within an undergraduate programme, students will undertake a major computing project, normally in
their final year and normally as an individual activity, giving them the opportunity to demonstrate:

\begin{itemize}
\item their ability to apply practical and analytical skills present in the programme as a whole
\item innovation and/or creativity
\item synthesis of information, ideas and practices to provide a quality solution together with an evaluation of that solution
\item that their project meets a real need in a wider context
\item the ability to self-manage a significant piece of work
\item critical self-evaluation of the process
\end{itemize}

Projects must involve the production of a report which should include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Elucidation of the problem and the objectives of the project
\item an in-depth investigation of the context and literature, and where appropriate, other similar products (this section is
likely to be emphasised less for an IEng project)
\item where appropriate, a clear description of the stages of the life cycle undertaken
\item where appropriate, a description of how verification and validation were applied at these stages
\item where appropriate, a description of the use of tools to support the development process
\item a critical appraisal of the project, indicating the rationale for any design/implementation decisions, lessons learnt
during the course of the project, and evaluation (with hindsight) of the project outcome and the process of its
production (including a review of the plan and any deviations from it)
\item a description of any research hypothesis
\item in the event that the individual work is part of a group enterprise, a clear indication of the part played by the author in
achieving the goals of the project and its effectiveness
\item references 
\end{itemize}

In the event of this major activity being undertaken as part of a group enterprise, there is a requirement that the
assessment is such that the individual contribution of each student is measured against all the above learning
outcomes.

For accreditation for CITP, CEng or CSci, the individual project should be worth at least 30 credit points at level 6 or
above. The project must be passed without compensation.
For accreditation for IEng the individual project should be worth at least 20 credit points at level 5 or above. The project
must be passed without compensation.
