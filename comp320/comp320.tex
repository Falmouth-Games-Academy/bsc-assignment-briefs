You are required to deliver a major \textbf{research project} as part of your degree; either in the form of \textbf{empirical research} relating to computing for games, or \textbf{practice-based research} related to game development. Individually, you explore a field that interests you, and for which there is a clearly identified need. This module forms the first part of this project and provides the opportunity to conduct a literature review, as well as to collect and analyse data using appropriate methods and statistics.

These assignments are formed of several parts:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Complete} an Application for Research Ethics Approval form,
		outlining the proposed research and highlighting any ethical
		considerations.
		\textbf{Note that you \textit{must} complete and submit Part A
		\textit{before} carrying out any experimental work.}
	\item \textbf{Deliver} a 15-minute presentation that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{explain} the context of your project
			\item \textbf{identify} and \textbf{discuss} the scientific literature
				relevant to your project
			\item \textbf{propose} one or more research questions for your project
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \label{part:review-draft} \textbf{Write} a draft research review and proposal

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

These assignments form a \textbf{research} task, consisting of \textbf{academic reading}, \textbf{academic writing},
\textbf{software development} and \textbf{scientific experimentation}.

For the \textbf{prototype research artefact}, there is no set GitHub repository.
However you are strongly encouraged to create one.
Ensure that you set up the \texttt{.gitignore} file for your chosen development environment,
and maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

For the \textbf{research review and proposal}, fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp320-proposal}

Use the existing LaTeX template, which is based on the IEEE Transactions style,
to write your literature review and proposal.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part A, download the Research Ethics Approval Application Form
from the COMP320 area on LearningSpace.
Complete the form in consultation with your project supervisor.
Print and sign the form, and hand it to your supervisor for approval.

\textbf{Important:} carrying out \textbf{any} experimental work
without first completing Part A is a breach of Falmouth University's Research Ethics Policy.
This will be treated as a case of academic misconduct, and penalised accordingly.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.
To pass, answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item What is the context of your project? How does it fit into the
		research field of computing for games?
	\item What are the key results from the literature upon which your project will be built?
	\item What is the current state of knowledge in the field?
		What are the open questions and challenges?
	\item What is (are) the key research question(s) that you will seek to
		answer in your project?
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a short (15-minute) presentation 
and deliver it in the scheduled session in week~7.
Prepare your slides using your choice of presentation software
(e.g.\ Beamer, reveal.js, PowerPoint).

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C consists of a \textbf{single formative submission},
however your project supervisor may also set additional \textbf{formative submissions} at their discretion.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part C, use the provided LaTeX template to write a literature review and proposal.
Do \textbf{not} modify the formatting of the provided template.
You are advised to bear in mind the page limit specified for Part~D
and attempt to adhere to it at this stage,
however you will \textbf{not} be penalised for failing to do so.

Push your document to GitHub and open a pull request
in advance of the scheduled peer review session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from tutor and peers.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D consists of a \textbf{single summative submission},
however your project supervisor may also set additional \textbf{formative submissions} at their discretion.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{holistic} basis,
according to the descriptors set out at the end of this document.

To complete Part D, revise your document from Part C
to address any issues highlighted during the peer review.
Your document must not exceed \textbf{six pages} of text,
excluding figures, tables, references and appendices.
This is subject to the usual policy on word and page limits available on LearningSpace.

Upload your final \texttt{.pdf} file to the LearningSpace.
Note that LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.pdf} file.

You will receive immediate and continuous \textbf{informal feedback} through meetings with your supervisor.
You will also receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the formative deadline.

\subsection*{Part E}

Part E consists of a \textbf{single summative submission},
however your project supervisor may also set additional \textbf{formative submissions} at their discretion.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part E, design and implement a piece of research software appropriate to your chosen project.
Create a Trello board setting out the key requirements for the software,
and identifying which requirements will be tackled this study block
and which are stretch goals to be left until later.
Check the source code into a version control repository regularly.
Ensure your \texttt{readme.md} file contains any information required to build and run the artefact, if appropriate.

Upload a \texttt{.zip} file containing your source code, associated assets, and screenshots of your Trello board to the LearningSpace.
Note that LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive immediate and continuous \textbf{informal feedback} through meetings with your supervisor.
You will also receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the formative deadline.

\subsection*{Part F}

Part F consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.
To pass, answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item What is (are) the key research question(s) that you will seek to
		answer in your project?
	\item How will answering these questions contribute to the state of knowledge
		in the field of your project?
	\item What methodology will you use to seek answers to these questions?
		Justify your methodology.
	\item What preliminary results have you obtained?
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part F, prepare a short (15-minute) presentation 
and deliver it in the scheduled session in week~13.

\section*{Appendix: British Computer Society Requirements}

An individual project is an expectation within undergraduate, integrated masters, and postgraduate masters programmes in computing. Students must be provided with written guidance on all aspects of the project, including selection,conduct, supervision, milestones, format of the report and the criteria for assessment. All projects should reflect the aims and learning outcomes which characterise the programme to which they contribute as set out in the programme specification.

It is expected that within an undergraduate programme, students will undertake a major computing project, normally in
their final year and normally as an individual activity, giving them the opportunity to demonstrate:

\begin{itemize}
\item their ability to apply practical and analytical skills present in the programme as a whole
\item innovation and/or creativity
\item synthesis of information, ideas and practices to provide a quality solution together with an evaluation of that solution
\item that their project meets a real need in a wider context
\item the ability to self-manage a significant piece of work
\item critical self-evaluation of the process
\end{itemize}

Projects must involve the production of a report which should include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Elucidation of the problem and the objectives of the project
\item an in-depth investigation of the context and literature, and where appropriate, other similar products (this section is
likely to be emphasised less for an IEng project)
\item where appropriate, a clear description of the stages of the life cycle undertaken
\item where appropriate, a description of how verification and validation were applied at these stages
\item where appropriate, a description of the use of tools to support the development process
\item a critical appraisal of the project, indicating the rationale for any design/implementation decisions, lessons learnt
during the course of the project, and evaluation (with hindsight) of the project outcome and the process of its
production (including a review of the plan and any deviations from it)
\item a description of any research hypothesis
\item in the event that the individual work is part of a group enterprise, a clear indication of the part played by the author in
achieving the goals of the project and its effectiveness
\item references 
\end{itemize}

In the event of this major activity being undertaken as part of a group enterprise, there is a requirement that the
assessment is such that the individual contribution of each student is measured against all the above learning
outcomes.

For accreditation for CITP, CEng or CSci, the individual project should be worth at least 30 credit points at level 6 or
above. The project must be passed without compensation.
For accreditation for IEng the individual project should be worth at least 20 credit points at level 5 or above. The project
must be passed without compensation.
