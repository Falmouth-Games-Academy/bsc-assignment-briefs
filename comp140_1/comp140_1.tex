\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you are required to design and prototype a novel game controller device.
Your prototype should function as an input device for \textbf{either}
one of the games being developed by students on the BA Digital Games course; \textbf{or}
the game you developed in COMP130 last semester.
Your prototype should use a hardware platform such as \emph{MaKey~MaKey}, \emph{Arduino}, \emph{Raspberry~Pi} etc,
to convert user actions into game inputs.

%Computing for Games combines technical and creative skills in equal parts.
%All of your assignments involve a mixture of the two;
%in this assignment the emphasis is more on creativity.
%You will build upon the technical skills you have learned so far,
%combined with your own creativity and innovation,
%to produce a unique creative artefact.

This assignment is formed of \textbf{three} parts.
The summative submission has \textbf{two} parts: an electronic component and a physical component.
Begin by forking the GitHub project at the following URL:
\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp140-hardware}
\end{center}

\subsection*{A. \emph{Design} a novel game controller device}

On GitHub, create a Markdown file (or edit \texttt{readme.md})
defining the high concept of your controller.
Include details of any background research you have done to assess commercial viability.

On Trello, create a task board that defines the key requirements
(in terms of components and user stories) of the controller.

\textbf{Formative submission:} Arrange a meeting with your tutor to discuss your concept and task board.

\subsection*{B. \emph{Build} and  \emph{integrate} a prototype of your game controller}

You will build your prototype controller over \textbf{two sprints}.
You should aim to have a `potentially shippable' prototype at the end of each sprint;
that is, a prototype which does not have any major flaws or half-finished features that prevent it from being tested,
and that can be used (even if lacking some features) as a controller in the game.

Use this forked repository to store any digital artefacts (including but not limited to
design sketches, photographs, art assets, source code, electronic circuit designs).

\textbf{Formative submission:} Participate in the two sprint review sessions in class.

\subsection*{C. \emph{Demonstrate} your controller}

Bring your prototype controller to the demo session in class,
and be prepared to discuss it with tutors and peers.

For submission, you must also prepare a short \textbf{video demonstration} of your controller.
The maximum length of this video is \textbf{two minutes};
longer videos will be subject to penalties in line with the course word count policy available on LearningSpace.
In your video, briefly demonstrate the functionality of the controller.
You may narrate if you wish, but it is not required.

\textbf{Formative submission:} Participate in the demo session.

\subsection*{Summative submission (electronic)}

Create a zip file containing the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A markdown file named \texttt{readme.md} giving a high-level overview of the project,
    including your concept and background research from part~A.
\item Screenshots of your Trello task board from part~A.
    As a minimum, include one from the beginning of each sprint,
    one from the end of the project,
    and screenshots documenting any checklists or other information within your cards.
\item All source code and other digital artefacts created for part~B.
    You should include source code files or snippets demonstrating the integration of your controller into the game,
    but you do \textbf{not} need to provide the entire source code for the game.
\item The video demonstration produced for part~C, compressed in AVI or MP4 format.
\end{itemize}

The recommended way to produce this zip file is to check all of the above into your GitHub repository
throughout the course of the project,
and then use the ``Download Zip'' function on the GitHub website.

\textbf{Material not included in the zip file will not be marked},
even if it is available online, and even if tutors have seen it in class.
Please ensure that all material you want the markers to consider is included in your submission.

Upload your zip file to the appropriate submission queue on LearningSpace.

\subsection*{Summative submission (physical)}

Hand in your prototype controller to the Academic Office in Tremough House.
Pack your controller in a suitably sized box, with your student number
and ``BSc Computing for Games -- COMP140 Assignment 1'' written clearly on it.

Your prototype will be returned to you after marking,
however any components that are property of the university (e.g.\ MaKey MaKey boards)
will first be removed.
Thus please do not glue, solder or otherwise permanently affix anything to them.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Falmouth University is nationally and internationally renowned as an arts institution.
Despite the fact that you are studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in a technical discipline,
you are still expected to strive for the same level of \textbf{innovation and creative flair}
as your fellow students in other departments.
All assignments on this course involve a mix of technical and creative activities;
this assignment is more heavily weighted towards the creative than the assignments you have completed thus far.
On this assignment, a competent execution of an unimaginative idea is unlikely to achieve higher than a C grade overall,
as opposed to an imperfect execution of a unique and ambitious concept
--- bear this in mind when working on your design.
One approach to promoting creativity is
\textbf{divergent thinking}: generation of ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
Often the most interesting ideas are \textbf{subversive}: they deliberately go against the
accepted or most obvious solution

The history of video games is littered with failed peripherals which consumers simply did not want,
which were perceived as expensive gimmicks rather than legitimate enhancements to gameplay.
Your creativity should be balanced by \textbf{commercial awareness}:
your design should be informed by your research into products that have succeeded and failed
in the past, and what underexploited niches exist in the present.
An A$^*$ project would be a highly divergent idea, but one that has clear commercial viability.
Do not be too discouraged if you fall short of this: this is a tall order even for the professionals!

We have given you some of the materials you need: a MaKey~MaKey kit, crocodile clip leads and conductive paint.
You will need to add your own materials to produce a \textbf{functional} physical prototype.
A ``Blue Peter'' style prototype made from household items is fine,
as is something made out of modelling clay, construction toys etc.
However you should still choose your materials carefully, as overly flimsy construction may
lose you marks on the functionality criterion.

You may also wish to connect electronic components such as LEDs, buzzers, photoresistors etc to the MaKey~MaKey,
or even use a different, more flexible hardware platform such as Arduino.
However you are discouraged from spending large sums of money on extra hardware,
and doing so is \textbf{not required} to achieve a high mark.
If you choose to go down this route,
it is possible to purchase an Arduino and a selection of electronic components online for 
around the price of a textbook (\textsterling 20 -- \textsterling 30).\footnote{
    Note that the MaKey~MaKey kits provided in class are version~1.2, which, unlike earlier versions, is not based on Arduino.
    Any tutorials you may find online for reprogramming the MaKey~MaKey firmware using the Arduino IDE
    are unfortunately not applicable to this version.
}

You should aim to demonstrate a high level of \textbf{sophistication}
in the technical execution of your prototype.
An important part of sophistication is having the insight to choose the right tool for the job:
if a simpler technique fulfils all the requirements, use it.
The use of unnecessarily complicated techniques, serving only to showcase one's own cleverness,
is a dangerous habit for a software developer.

The sole purpose of the \textbf{video demonstration} is to aid moderators and external examiners,
who are not present for the demo session,
in assessing your work.
Your video does \textbf{not} need to be entertaining or highly polished:
a smartphone or webcam video of you or someone else using the controller is sufficient.

%Your \textbf{weekly reports} should document the iterations you make on your design and prototyping.
%The emphasis in this assignment is on creativity and rapid iteration,
%so do not be afraid to ``go back to the drawing board'' if a prototyped idea does not work as well as anticipated.
%However it is important to document (and learn from) your failures, even more so than your successes.
%
%You are strongly encouraged to make use of sketches, diagrams, photographs, screenshots
%and short videos to document your design and prototyping process.
%Many indie game developers use such work-in-progress material as an important tool for promotion
%and community engagement; for example, search Twitter for the hashtag \texttt{\#screenshotsaturday}.
%Videos should ideally be short (5--30 second) demonstrations of functions of your prototype;
%you may narrate if you wish, but it is not required.
