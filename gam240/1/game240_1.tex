\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you will prepare a production prototype of your product. You will continue to work in the same manner as you have during the pre-production stage (i.e., COMP230). However, a potentially shippable product should be delivered.

The ability to scope a project and diligently execute it is highly desired in the games industry. Companies do not make money working on products; they make money by shipping products! Thus, getting a prototype to the stage where it could be submitted to a publisher or distribution platform is important. Further to this, commercial considerations do not end. Engagement with the press will need to persist throughout production, so as to ensure market interest at launch.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Launch}, as a \textbf{group}, a GitHub Pages website which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describe} the game;
    		\item as well as \textbf{promote} the game's key features and aesthetics.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as a \textbf{group}, a plan which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    	    	\item \textbf{identify} the skills and time available to complete the final prototype;
    		\item \textbf{describe} the key user stories that will comprise the final prototype;
    		\item and \textbf{highlight} the stories most critical to the technical demo.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, an initial production prototype which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{illustrate} the product's core features and unique selling points;
    		\item and \textbf{include} at least \textbf{one} non-trivial contribution from \textbf{each} member of the group.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write}, as a \textbf{group}, a press kit for the website which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{generate} press interest in the game.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, a final production prototype which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as an \textbf{individual}, an A3 research-style poster that:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{outlines and discusses} the engineering of the final prototype;
    		\item and \textbf{describes one} algorithm that you \textbf{individually} implemented. 
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as a \textbf{group}, a `technical demo' which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} the technical content of your own poster;
    		\item and \textbf{demonstrate} the final production prototype of the game.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
  
\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{product development task}. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp230-production}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{Visual Studio}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item The website is live;
	\item The game is adequetely described;
	\item The aesthetic is illustrated with at least four screenshots;
	\item The core game mechanics are illustrated with at least one video.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, setup GitHub Pages and populate a single web page with content. Show it to your tutor in the first scheduled sprint review session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Only well-formed user stories are included;
	\item The user stories form a comprehensive plan;
	\item The plan has reasonable scope and is feasible.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, setup and populate the team Trello board. Ensure that all members of the team are added to the board. Show it to your tutor in the scheduled CPD catch-up tutorial.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is formed of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of another team's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare a draft version of the production prototype. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to \textit{each} scheduled sprint review session. Ensure that you attend \textit{each} scheduled sprint review session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} and \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item The press kit is available online;
	\item The development team are introduced and credited for their work;
	\item Key flavour text and unique selling points are included;
	\item The aesthetic is illustrated with at least four screenshots;

To complete Part D, incorporate the press kit into a second web page. Show it to your tutor in \textit{each} scheduled sprint review session after the first.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part E}

Part E is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part E, revise the production prototype based on the feedback you have received and tidy up any incomplete features. Please also ensure that you include appropriate screen-shots of the Trello board in a separate folder. Then, upload the source code to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file. The recommended way of generating the \texttt{.zip} file is using the \textit{[Download Zip]} button on the GitHub website.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\subsection*{Part F}

Part F is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

	\item At least \textbf{one} non-trivial algorithm is described
	\item The algorithm was implemented by the person submitting the work
	\item The description of the algorithm is detailed and accurate
	\item There is sufficient detail to show how the algorithm fits into the overall architecture of the game
	\item There is little to no overlap with other members of the team
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part F, prepare the poster using any word processing and/or presentation tool. Then, upload the relevant files to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{informal feedback} from your tutor three days prior to Part E.

\subsection*{Part G}

Part G is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part G, look over your notes to prepare yourself to answer questions. Ensure that you are comfortable with the content of your poster and discuss any concerns with your tutor. Then, attend the scheduled technical demo session. Please ensure that you print your poster ahead of time and bring it with you. It should be printed on A3 paper and in portrait. This is your individual responsibility. Please, also ensure that one member of the team is able to setup a laptop with the production prototype ahead of time.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Carefully select the algorithm that you will take ownership of and implement. This algorithm will need to interface with other game components, and therefore affected by work of your peers. Aim for high cohesion and low coupling! It is also important that the main requirements are firmly specified and are not too broad. This will ensure that there is little overlap with the work of your peers and help ensure that you do not overburden yourself with too much work. 

Please remember to commit frequently and to push your source code and related assets to the GitHub repository. This will make it easier for you to maintain a backup of your work. It will also help you to measure your productivity. GitHub should be an essential part of your workflow, not merely a place to submit your work for feedback. You will be expected to maintain an archive of playable builds to demo your work at any time.

Poor planning and poor time management can have a significant impact on this assignment. As some of you may have already discovered, programming is quite unlike other subjects in that it cannot be ``crammed'' into a last minute deluge. Sustain a steady pace across the duration of the course. Do a little programming every day, if you can!

For the most part, your work will be marked as a group effort.
However we want to avoid the situation where students try to ``coast'' through the assignment
on their fellow group members' work,
and equally the situation where one member of the group takes the lion's share of the work
and prevents the others from contributing effectively.
Marks will be weighted by a multiplier for \textbf{individual contribution},
which aims to penalise both of these behaviours.
We assess this by several means, including but not limited to: sprint reviews; individual vivas; feedback from your peers;
attribution in the source code; and GitHub commit logs.
Any student who has contributed their \textit{fair share} of effort to the project will receive a fair \% for their effort,
so any student who is putting in the appropriate level of effort has no need to worry.
Note that effort is not the same as productivity.

Your code will be assessed on \textbf{functional coherence}:
how well the finished game corresponds to the user stories,
and whether the game has any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.

Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, libraries, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for complexity  
where something simpler would have sufficed.

\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve code comprehension,
and carefully choose the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
Use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation}.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
Consider allowing some literal values, where appropriate, to be ``tinkered'' without changing the source code,
e.g.\ by defining them in an external file read by the game on startup.
