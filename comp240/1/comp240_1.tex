In this assignment, you will research the market for your COMP240 project and present a business case. Specifically, to explore: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Whether there is an audience for the product you are developing;
    \item and which strategy will be the most successful to commercialise the product.
\end{enumerate}

Making games is a business. For the most part, game studios exists to make money. There are many business models, each having its own constraints and viability---even for those soley interested in games for art. All game developers must eat and sleep! To maximise your chance of success in the games industry and to confer some of the entrepreneurial agency that Falmouth University is famed for, this assignment will help you develop an appreciation for the commercial forces behind game development. An evaluation of a market and the construction of a business case will expose some of these forces.

\todo[inline, color=announce]{\textbf{Role-Play Scenario:} Your current group is taking the game to market using \texttt{Itch.IO} as the sole distributor. You estimate the game will sell 10,000 units and agree a minimum net profit of \textsterling 5 per unit, once pricing and other costs have been assessed. You anticipate production will require six more months to make the game polished and functionally complete. After which, you have several game ideas you would like to develop. So far, the team enjoys working together and you all feel that you are getting good results.

\vspace{1em}

Until this point, the team has run `under the radar' by working remotely and drawing benefits during development. However, an opportunity has presented itself which would enable everyone to: (i) get paid; (ii) have a real company with an office to work in; and (iii) be able to tell people that they are real game developers. A publisher likes the look of your game and is proposing a deal (see the additional guidence section). It is your job to conduct a strategic evaluation of the two business options (to stick with self-publishing or to go with the publisher).}

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Present} a \presentationMinutes-minute market evaluation and business case that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{outline how} lucrative the target market is, with reference to relevant concepts from the business canvas;
    		\item \textbf{contrast} self-publishing to the deal offered by the publisher;
    		\item and \textbf{justify} a recommendation.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft \essayWordCount-page report which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item  \textbf{evaluate} the market \textbf{and} the two routes to maket;
    		\item  \textbf{investigate and contrast} the two business models;
    		\item  as well as \textbf{recommend} the \textbf{most} appropriate business case.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a final \essayWordCount-page report that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{business task}. There is no GitHub repository. Use any word-processing, graphics, and/or desktop publishing tools as well as the platform(s) of your choice to prepare your presentation slide-deck and report.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Business modelling is adequately addressed using CANVAS;
	\item The self-publishing and publisher-deal models are suitably compared;
	\item A recommendation is made, with at least some sensible justification.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, prepare a 10-20-30 style presentation. Create exactly 10 slides for your slide-deck using a tool of your choice. Leverage details specific to the game you are working on to formulate a sensible a business model and recommend one of the two propositions. You are presenting to publishers. So, tell us your decision and justify why. Practice your argument and discuss the options with your peers ahead of your presentiation slot in Week 7. Then, attend the scheduled presentation session.

You will receive \textbf{informal feedback} from your tutor within 3 working days after the session.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a draft version of the business report. This is quite an extensive piece, so ensure that sufficient time has been allocated to, both: (i) explore and refine the underlying business models that will underpin your recommendation; and (ii) prepare a well-structured and visually interesting business report. Ensure this is made available as a \texttt{.pdf} document and uploaded to LearningSpace ahead of the peer-review workshop in Week 8. Then, attend the scheduled session.

You will receive \textbf{peer feedback} within 3 working days after the session.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part C, revise the market evaluation and business case report based on the feedback you have received. Take care to ensure the recommendation is clear and sufficiently justified by the body of the report. Then, upload the report to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.pdf} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

It is critically important that you carefully review the details of the deal offered to you by the publisher in making your decision:

\todo[inline, color=announce]{\textbf{Publisher Deal:} The publisher will fund up to 12 months (about \textsterling 100k of development) using the current team through an advance that will be recouped against sales. There is a local business park that can accommodate the whole team and provide suitable development machines and associated resources for \textsterling 1200 per calendar month.

\vspace{1em}

The game will be initially release on Steam at a gross price of \textsterling 15. The publisher will commit a further \textsterling 50k marketing advance that will be also be recouped against sales. The publisher estimates that the game should sell between 30-50,000 units and once the initial advances have been recouped, there will be a 50:50 royalty split. Once the game meets the upper end of the sales targets (40,000 units), console ports will be triggered. This will be a go / no go decision after 3 months of sales data and the PC version will be launched as soon as it is complete.

\vspace{1em}

For console ports, the publisher will provide a \textsterling 50k advance for development of PS4, XboxOne \& Switch skus. It is expected that all 3 versions can be turned over within 6 months and a skeleton team of 2 programmers and a producer / designer will be required working across all platform skus. The publisher will manage all sku testing.
 
\vspace{1em}

On completion, the publisher will commit a further \textsterling 150k marketing advance to ensure that the game will get great coverage on release.
Console targets suggest an average of 20,000 sales per platform with average net revenue of \textsterling 5 per sale and this would be split 50:50 once advances had been recovered.
The developer would retain ownership of the current IP, though the publisher would retain the right of first refusal on publishing future development work with the IP. Further work on novel IP would be discussed on completion of the console versions.}

Use the \textit{Business CANVAS} as an analytic framework to frame your recommendation. It will be presented as a professional management report. The page count may seem intimidating but, in terms of prep, is broadly equivilient to the essays you have written until this point. Indicately, the report should include:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Front Cover
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item This should be a single page with your company and game name.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Excutive Summary
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item Report Highlights (1 page, but only about half-a-page of content)
	\end{enumerate}
\item Market Evaluation
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item Game Value Proposition (1 page);
    		\item Marketing Personas (at least 4 personas across 2 pages).
    	\end{enumerate}		
\item Route to Market --- Self-Publishing for PC Release	
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]	
    		\item Market Position and Route to Market using \texttt{Itch.IO} (1 page);
    		\item Revenue Spreadsheet (1 page).
	\end{enumerate}
\item Route to Market --- Publisher-Deal for Console Release  
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]	
    		\item Market Position and Route to Market using Publisher (1 page);
    		\item Revenue Spreadsheet (1 page).
	\end{enumerate}	
\item Development Plan
     	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]	
    		\item PC Development (1 page);
    		\item Console development with a reduced headcount (1 page);
    		\item Development cash-flow (1 page).
	\end{enumerate}		
\item Conclusion	
     	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]	
    		\item Assumptions and risks (half a page);
    		\item Accuracy and/or relevance of publisher information based on your game (half a page);
    		\item Recommendation and justification as to whether to accept the publisher offer (1 page).
	\end{enumerate}		
\end{enumerate}
