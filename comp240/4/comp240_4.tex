\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you critically reflect on your progress across the Semester. This involves reviewing key weaknesses that influence the quality of your work. From this, you develop plans of continuing personal development.

Such reflection and planning is an extremely important part of learning games development. Research shows that deliberate practice is very effective at nurturing expertise in software engineering. Everyone properly adopting CPD eventually succeeds, despite the challenging nature of programming.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a series of brief weekly reports (about 100-200 words) that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describe} your progress;
    		\item \textbf{identify} and \textbf{assess} at least \textbf{one} challenge you have encountered;
    		\item and then \textbf{outline} at least \textbf{one} specific action that will help you to overcome this challenge.
	\end{enumerate}
	    \item \textbf{Write}, in addition to your weekly reports, a brief summary of your experience (about 100-200 words) that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{specify} your career goals;
    		\item \textbf{describe} your progress towards these goals;
    		\item \textbf{identify} at least \textbf{five} key challenges across different domains;
    		\item and then \textbf{outline five} SMART actions that may help you to overcome these challenges.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft 1200-word report that must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{identify five} key skills that you consider obstacles;
    		\item \textbf{justify} the relevance \textbf{and} importance of \textbf{each} of these skills, with respect to professional game development;
    		\item \textbf{assess} your application of \textbf{each} of these skills, \textit{describing how} they affected the quality of your work;
    		\item and then \textbf{suggest how} to overcome \textbf{each} of these obstacles, with reference to SMART actions.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a final 1200-word report that must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{reflective writing task} and so regular reflection is expected. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp150-cpd}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file. 

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{TeX}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Progress has been described with adequate detail;
	\item Problems and issues have been clearly explained and assessed;
	\item There is evidence of reflection;
	\item At least one appropriate SMART objective has been actioned;
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, write each report in the \texttt{readme.md} document. Separate each week with a heading. Attend the scheduled catch-up tutorials and show the document to your tutor. 

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your tutor.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, write each report in the \texttt{readme.md} document. Separate each week with a heading. Ensure that your summary is included at the top of the\texttt{readme.md} document under a separate heading. Then, attend the scheduled catch-up tutorials and show the document to your tutor. 

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your tutor.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare a draft version of the CPD report. Use the rubric at the end of this document to inform the structure of the document. Ensure that the TeX source and compiled \texttt{*.pdf} are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled task review session. Then, attend the scheduled CPD catch-up session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your tutor.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the assessment criteria in the marking rubric at the end of this document for further insight.

To complete Part D, revise the reflective report based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload the reflective report to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{*.pdf} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

\textbf{Reflection} is taking time to examine thoughts, feelings, beliefs, values, attitudes and assumptions in the context of a specific topic, situation, problem, issue, or process. Part of reflection is relating these varied understandings to your experience, then analysing how and why something arose. Building upon this, you can predict future performance. \textbf{Planning}, therefore, is identifying which challenges can be overcome and setting a series of activities you do to resolve those challenges. \textbf{Learning} is engaging in those SMART actions, thereby improving your performance or at least fulfilling some pre-requisite to enhancing performance in the future. \textbf{Evaluating} is measuring your new level of performance. Use this to assess the quality of your actions. Not all actions will be successful . This is to be expected. Nevertheless, such evaluation will still need to feed-into your future reflection.

\end{center}

This process is cyclical, as illustrated above. It is, after all, \textit{continuous} personal development (also referred to as\textit{continuous professional development} by those in industry). You will be expected to engage in CPD throughout the degree course, with a deliverable every single semester. This will also form the cornerstone of ongoing improvement across the duration of your career.

A common mistake made by beginners to reflective writing is to merely describe the context and/or the experience. Avoid this. Description is not particularly important. It is the \textbf{analysis} and \textbf{evaluation} of an experience which is important. This is because it will reveal insights about yourself and your actions, which will help you to focus on the most relevant weaknesses.

Another common mistake is to focus too much on any one single domain. Your experience is holistic and there are many domains of practice that contribute to it. For example: the \textbf{affective domain}, such as your ability to identify and manage different mental states and emotions; the \textbf{interpersonal domain}, such as your ability to communicate and organise activity with peers; the \textbf{dispositional domain}, such as your ability to manage time and remain disciplined; the \textbf{cognitive domain}, such as your knowledge of programming languages or frameworks; and the \textbf{procedural domain}, such as your abilities to apply computing concepts and problem solving skills. 

Keep in mind that programming, in particular, is a skill that not only taxes groups of skills across all of these domains, but also demands a significant investment in time and energy to develop. It is a commitment! So, of course, regular practice is important. However! It is the \textbf{quality} of your practice that is more important than \textbf{quantity} of your practice.

Deliberate practice follows naturally from this continuous cycle of reflection, planning, practice, and evaluation. This means that \textbf{reflection is a forethought} rather than an afterthought. Avoid leaving reflection to the last minute. Focus on the ongoing development process early, and indeed, on the process itself. The quality of the end product may indicate the existence of challenges, but it is only through deep reflection on working practice that it becomes clear why those challenges arose and how to avoid them.

Effective deliberate practice is: conscious and intentional; designed with current skill in mind, forcing discomfort while avoiding frustration; provides relevant measures to track progress; and follows a repeatable structure.

When planning such practice, do not be too general. Consider \textbf{SMART} actions: \textbf{specific}; \textbf{measurable}; \textbf{achievable}; \textbf{relevant}; and \textbf{time-bound}. Ensure that your plan for future development meets all five of these criteria. Also note, problem solving and designing are particularly important programming skills and approaches to developing skills in these areas can be relevant.

When choosing which \textbf{skills} to focus on for this report, be specific. Avoid choosing broad skills that are clearly important for any student, such as ``time management'' or ``communication''. Instead, consider which \textbf{specific} aspects of these skills are a priority for \textbf{you}. We are not assessing your knowledge of general study skills, rather we are assessing your ability to analyse and reflect on your own learning as an individual.
