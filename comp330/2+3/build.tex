\section*{Introduction}

This is your final year game development project. It is a major undertaking, affording the opportunity to present a portfolio piece that showcases what you have learned across the degree. There are many configurations for this work. You can: (i) join an existing game development team as a `technical specialist' to work on one or more game components; (ii) act individually as a `consultant' for multiple BA teams to work with one particular emerging technology---delivering a tech demo; (iii) form your own team, extending your research projects and integrating them into an original game as cutting-edge game components; or (iv) work as an individual to develop a game-making tool or game middleware. Use any programming language or technology the Games Academy has access to.

Gaming is a diverse ecology. Experiencing different roles and cross-disciplinary challenges is important. Computing professionals frequently encounter them.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as an \textbf{individual or group}, an initial pre-production prototype of the product which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{illustrate} the project's core objectives, features, and unique selling points.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as an \textbf{individual or group}, a final pre-production prototype of the product which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your product owner and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as an \textbf{individual}, an A3 poster which:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{outlines} the core features and unique selling points of your project;
		\item \textbf{illustrates} your individual contribution.
    		\item and \textbf{justifies}, where relevant, the market need for the project---whether research \textbf{or} enterprise.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual}, a `poster demo` that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} the product and its design, as shown in the poster;
    		\item and \textbf{demonstrate} the final pre-production prototype.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{product development task}.

There is no defined method of version control or repository.

\todo[inline]{If you are not working with other students, you are a group of one. As such, all references to group, collaborative, and/or teamwork activities refer to yourself as an individual. Involving BA students in such activites is optional.}

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A is formed of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is either \textbf{individual} pr \textbf{collaborative}depending on your mode of work. You will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Playable builds are made available in a timely manner;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, prepare draft versions of the pre-production prototype ahead of the \textbf{sprint review meetings} with your product owner. Ensure that the source code and related assets are made available prior to \textbf{EACH} scheduled meeting. Then, attend the scheduled meetings.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{product owner}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single summative submission}.This work is either \textbf{individual} pr \textbf{collaborative}depending on your mode of work. It will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part B, revise the pre-production prototype based on the feedback you have received and finish any incomplete features. Then, upload the source code to the LearningSpace. If you are working with an existing game development team, they will submit the final executable build physically. Otherwise, you must include a link to your build in your submission to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file. 

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. Ensure the presentation addresses the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The title and high concept of the product
	\item The target audience and market
	\item The concept's unique selling points and how they distinguish it from competitors
	\item The design's technical and production feasibility
	\item The project's commercial feasibility
\end{itemize}

To complete Part C, prepare the poster using any word processing and/or presentation tool. Then, upload the relevant files to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{informal feedback} from your tutor during Part D.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part D, practice the delivery of the poster demo. Ensure that you are comfortable with the presentation medium and discuss any concerns with your tutor. Then, attend the scheduled poster demo session. Please ensure that you print out and bring your poster to the session. Please, also ensure that you setup a workstation with the pre-production demo ahead of time.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the poster-demo session.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Avoid poor planning and time management. By now this will be a familiar phrase, but it is no less true.
In particular, avoid underestimating the effort required to implement even simple software; always consider scope.
From the pitch stage, you should consider very carefully what is feasible.

For the most part, your work will be marked as a group effort.
However we want to avoid the situation where students try to ``coast'' through the assignment
on their fellow group members' work,
and equally the situation where one member of the group takes the lion's share of the work
and prevents the others from contributing effectively.
Marks will be weighted by a multiplier for \textbf{individual contribution},
which aims to penalise both of these behaviours.
We assess this by several means, including but not limited to: sprint reviews; individual vivas; feedback from your peers;
attribution in the source code; and GitHub commit logs.
Any student who has contributed their \textit{fair share} of effort to the project will receive a fair \% for their effort,
so any student who is putting in the appropriate level of effort has no need to worry.
Note that effort is not the same as productivity.

The first step in planning your implementation should be to break your concept down into \textbf{user stories}. 
Your user stories should be \textbf{distinguishable} (i.e.\ there should be little overlap between them)
and \textbf{easily measured} (i.e.\ it should be easy to tell when each user story has been implemented).
They should also be \textbf{comprehensive}, i.e.\ the user stories should completely capture the
desired functionality of the game, with no gaps.
Imagine giving your user stories to a developer who has never seen a product of this type before.
Would they be able to implement the software correctly, or would they miss key features?

%Wherever possible, you should clearly \textbf{attribute} the author(s) of segments of your code.
%The easiest way to do this is by inserting appropriate comments, for example:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%/* This function was written by student 1511111 */
%\end{lstlisting}
%\begin{lstlisting}
%/* This function was pair-programmed by students 1522222 and 1533333 */
%\end{lstlisting}
%\begin{lstlisting}
%/* This function was adapted by student 1544444 from an example at http://stackoverflow.com/a/1657490 */
%\end{lstlisting}

Your code will be assessed on \textbf{functional coherence}:
how well the finished product corresponds to the user stories,
and whether it has any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.

Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, libraries, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for complexity  
where something simpler would have sufficed.

\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve code comprehension,
and carefully choose the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
Use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation}.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
Consider allowing some literal values, where appropriate, to be ``tinkered'' without changing the source code,
e.g.\ by defining them in an external file read at startup.

As with all assignments on this course, you are expected to display a level of
\textbf{innovation and creative flair} befitting Falmouth University's reputation as a world-leading
arts institution.
We are looking for creativity; but, 
you will \textbf{not} be judged on the quality of your art assets.
One approach to promoting creativity is
\textbf{divergent thinking}: generating ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
Often the most interesting ideas are \textbf{subversive}: they deliberately go against
convention or obvious solutions.
