 These assignments form the second part of your \textbf{major research project}; whether \textbf{empirical research} relating to computing for games, or \textbf{practice-based research} in game development. It is your opportunity to collect and analyse primary data and prepare a manuscript to disseminate your findings.

Together, they are formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Complete} your research artefact, ensuring that you:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{apply} a rigorous software project management approach;
			\item and \textbf{follow} best practices in software engineering.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Collect} data relating to your research question,
		ensuring that you:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{apply} a rigorous research method;
			\item \textbf{leverage} your research artefact appropriately;
			\item and \textbf{conform} with all ethical requirements.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Deliver} a 20-minute presentation that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{analyse and synthesise} your findings.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \label{part:review-draft} \textbf{Write} a 12-page academic dissertation in IEEE format
		that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{identify} and \textbf{review} the scientific literature relevant to your project;
			\item \textbf{outline and justify} one or more research questions;
			\item \textbf{outline and justify} the methodology applied in addressing the research question(s);
			\item \textbf{analyse} data you have obtained;
			\item as well as \textbf{interpret and discuss} your findings.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Prepare} the final 12-page academic dissertation in IEEE format that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{address} any issues raised through peer-review;
			\item \textbf{and evaluate} the outcome of the research project.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Deliver} a 20-minute presentation that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{showcase} the final research artefact;
			\item and \textbf{defend} the claims made in the academic dissertation.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

These assignments form a \textbf{research} task, consisting of \textbf{academic reading}, \textbf{academic writing},
\textbf{software development}, and \textbf{scientific experimentation}.

For the \textbf{prototype research artefact}, there is no set GitHub repository.
However you are strongly encouraged to create one.
Ensure that you set up the \texttt{.gitignore} file for your chosen development environment,
and maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

For the \textbf{research dissertation}, continue using the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp320-proposal}

Use the existing LaTeX template, which is based on the IEEE Transactions style,
to write your dissertation.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single summative submission}.
However, your supervisor may set additional \textbf{formative submissions} at their discretion.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{holistic} basis, according to the descriptors set out at the end of this document.

To complete Part A, implement your research artefact and show it to your research supervisor in a timetabled meeting. As
the requirements for the research artefact will vary by project, consult with your supervisor to verify whether or not the
artefact is adequete for the desired purpose.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your supervisor.

Then, upload a \texttt{.zip} file containing the final version of your source code and any assets/dependencies to the LearningSpace.
Note that LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the summative deadline.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part B, collect data and codify it into a digital dataset. Show this to your research supervisor in a timetabled meeting. 
As the research questions and methods will vary, consult with your supervisor to verify whether or not the
data is adequete for the desired purpose.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your supervisor.

\todo[inline]{\textbf{Important:} Carrying out \textbf{any} data collection or experimental work
without first securing ethical approval is a breach of Falmouth University's Research Ethics Policy.
This will be treated as a case of academic misconduct, and penalised accordingly.}

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.
To pass, answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item What is (are) the key research question(s) that you will seek to answer in your project?
	\item How will answering these questions contribute to the state of knowledge in the field of your project?
	\item Why have you applied particular methods in seeking answers to these questions?
	\item What results have you obtained?
	\item How have you analysed and interpreted these results?
	\item What are you likely to conclude on the basis of this research?
	\item What are the potential implications of your discoveries?
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare a 20-minute presentation and deliver it in the scheduled session. Prepare your slide-deck using your choice of presentation software (e.g.\ Beamer, reveal.js, PowerPoint). You may extend your existing slides from COMP320, but must incorporate new material and new findings.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your tutors.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. 
However, your supervisor may set additional \textbf{formative submissions} at their discretion.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part D, prepare a draft of the dissertation. This should \textit{build upon} and \textit{extend} your research proposal and
literature review. As such, overlap with the COMP320 submission is expected. However, there should be new material.
Use the provided LaTeX template and do \textbf{not} modify the formatting. Bring these to meetings with your supervisor.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your supervisor.

Then, bring \textbf{two physical print-outs} of your dissertation to the timetabled peer-review session. 
You are advised to consider the specified page limit and attempt to adhere to it at this stage; although, you will \textbf{not} be penalised at this point for failing to do so.  Also, ensure you also bring pens and highlighters.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from peers and \textit{in the following week} a \textbf{meta-review} from tutors.

\subsection*{Part E}

Part E consists of a \textbf{single summative submission}. However, your supervisor may set additional \textbf{formative submissions} at their discretion.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{holistic} basis, according to the descriptors set out at the end of this document.

To complete Part E, revise your manuscript to address any issues highlighted during the peer review.
Your document must not exceed \textbf{twelve pages} of text, excluding figures, tables, references and appendices.
This is subject to the policy on word and page limits available on the LearningSpace course page.

As an addendum to the research manuscript, an appendix containing at most one-page of critical reflection and self-evaluation should be incorporared. 
This should be a critical appraisal of the project, indicating the rationale for any key decisions, lessons learnt, and evaluation (with hindsight) of the process
and outcome of the project. 

Upload your final \texttt{.pdf} file to the LearningSpace.
Note that LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.pdf} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the formative deadline.

\subsection*{Part F}

Part F consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}.
This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.
To pass, answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item What was the purpose of your research?
	\item How did you approach the research?
	\item What did you discover?
	\item What are the implications of your findings?
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part F, prepare a 20-minute presentation in the timetabled session after the submission deadline.
Prepare your slides using your choice of presentation software (e.g.\ Beamer, reveal.js, PowerPoint).

\section*{Appendix: British Computer Society Requirements}

An individual project is an expectation within undergraduate, integrated masters, and postgraduate masters programmes in computing. Students must be provided with written guidance on all aspects of the project, including selection,conduct, supervision, milestones, format of the report and the criteria for assessment. All projects should reflect the aims and learning outcomes which characterise the programme to which they contribute as set out in the programme specification.

It is expected that within an undergraduate programme, students will undertake a major computing project, normally in
their final year and normally as an individual activity, giving them the opportunity to demonstrate:

\begin{itemize}
\item their ability to apply practical and analytical skills present in the programme as a whole
\item innovation and/or creativity
\item synthesis of information, ideas and practices to provide a quality solution together with an evaluation of that solution
\item that their project meets a real need in a wider context
\item the ability to self-manage a significant piece of work
\item critical self-evaluation of the process
\end{itemize}

Projects must involve the production of a report which should include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Elucidation of the problem and the objectives of the project
\item an in-depth investigation of the context and literature, and where appropriate, other similar products (this section is
likely to be emphasised less for an IEng project)
\item where appropriate, a clear description of the stages of the life cycle undertaken
\item where appropriate, a description of how verification and validation were applied at these stages
\item where appropriate, a description of the use of tools to support the development process
\item a critical appraisal of the project, indicating the rationale for any design/implementation decisions, lessons learnt
during the course of the project, and evaluation (with hindsight) of the project outcome and the process of its
