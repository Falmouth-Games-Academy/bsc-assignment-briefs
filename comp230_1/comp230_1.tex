In this assignment, you will research ethical and professional issues in the games development community and bring an academic perspective to its culture. Specifically, to explore: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Which ethical and professional challenges are prominent;
    \item and how professionals can conduct themselves in an ethical manner.
\end{enumerate}

The culture of the games industry will not only play a key role in shaping your future job satisfaction, but it will also be instrumental in determining the form of the cultural artefacts that you produce. You need to explore your values and determine what is important to you. Issues in the games industry span a wide range of topics, from \textit{EA Spouse} to \textit{Hot Coffee}, from the \textit{Edge Fiasco} to \textit{GamerGate}, from \textit{ConFlag Censorship} to \textit{Bondi Snubs}. Not to mention, controversy surrounding issues such as anti-social behaviour, violence, and addiction. Notions of ethical principles, codes of conduct, and professional bodies (e.g., BCS, ACM, IGDA, etc.) will aid such explorations. 

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a \proposalWordCount-word proposal \textbf{with} references which must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{justify} the importance of \textbf{one} ethical and/or professional issue;
    		\item and then \textbf{cite} at least \textbf{\minReferenceCount} appropriate academic references.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as a \textbf{group}, a \presentationMinutes-minute summary of your research that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} each issue \textbf{and} its importance;
    		\item \textbf{identify} appropriate research questions \textbf{and} avenues for research;
    		\item \textbf{debate how} each issue could be resolved;
    		\item and \textbf{discuss how} these issues affect the development community.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft \essayWordCount-word essay which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item  \textbf{address} the research question.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a final \essayWordCount-word essay which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\todo[inline]{\textbf{Note:} All research questions must be distinctive. Members of the same group must \textbf{not} target the same research question.}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is an \textbf{academic writing task}. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp230-ethics}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{TeX}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Research question is appropriate and distinctive;
	\item At least \minReferenceCount  academic peer-reviewed sources are cited.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, write your proposal in the \texttt{readme.md} document and then prepare the reference list using a \texttt{*.bib} file.  Show these to your tutor.  If acceptable, this will be signed-off. 

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Research questions are adequately addressed;
	\item Some evidence of academic rigour;
	\item Some insight into the relationship between theory and practice.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a presentation, and practice your debate and discussion. Prepare your slideshow collaboratively in TeX. Use the combined reference list of the group to broadly discuss each individual research question. Help each other. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub prior to the scheduled session. Then, attend the scheduled session.

You will receive \textbf{peer feedback} within 3 working days after the session.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare a draft version of the essay. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled session. Then, attend the scheduled session.

You will receive \textbf{peer feedback} within 3 working days after the session.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part D, revise the essay based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload the essay to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.pdf} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

As you progress into your second year, you will discover that a much greater level of intellectual independence is expected of you. Sessions now focus on student-driven dialogues where important issues are explored instead of merely presenting material. Your tutor is there to highlight opportunities for learning and to facilitate the dialogue. Not to provide answers. It is, therefore, critically important that all students research the topic for each dialogue in advance of attending. These are indicated to you in the session schedule on the LearningSpace.

Again, identifying the most appropriate ethical or professional challenge to address and then developing an appropriate research question is the most challenging aspect of these assignments. It is very unlikely that you will settle on the first research question that you propose. Question arise out of research and gaps in the literature. Furthermore, the question should relate to issues in the games industry. An example might be: ``What legal powers does an employee have to remedy a situation where a company refuses to credit their contribution to a game they worked on?''. You will need to discuss your question with your tutor and your peers to help focus it.

Areas where students tend to lose marks are: depth of insight; analytical skill; and evaluative skill. Depth of insight implies rigorous research, addressing one key challenge in much detail, rather than several challenges with weaker research and/or in less detail. Adequate analysis implies going beyond mere description, perhaps through: performing calculations, comparing sources, or even deploying reasoning to generate new insights. Adequate evaluation implies making appropriate reference to evidence and ensuring that evidence is of appropriate quality. Further to this, sound and valid arguments are constructed, criticising the claims made by other authors.

Focus on answering your research question. You have but 1000-words! Depth over breadth. Quality over quantity. Write concisely. Your ability to recall facts is not under assessment, your ability to construct an argument through critical analysis and making it relevant to practice is.
