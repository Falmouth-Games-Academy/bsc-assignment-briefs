\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
``Essentially everyone, when they first build a distributed application, makes the following eight assumptions:

\par - The network is reliable;
\par - Latency is zero;
\par - Bandwidth is infinite;
\par - The network is secure;
\par - Topology doesn't change;
\par - There is one administrator;
\par - Transport cost is zero;
\par - The network is homogeneous.

All prove to be false in the long run and all cause big trouble and painful learning experiences.''

\par --- Peter Deutsch

    \textit{MUD1}, written by Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle---now, Prof. Bartle---was the first virtual world to run multiplayer over a network. It was written in 1978, pre-dating the Internet.
}

In this assignment, you are required to implement a multiplayer online text-based adventure game using a client-server architecture. You have the option of using either the Python, Java, or C++ programming language to implement the game client.

Knowledge of computer networking is essential. You will need to work with highly sophisticated network technologies to satisfy increasing demand for social experiences in games. Experience working with client-server architectures, in particular, is highly desired by employers even outside games.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Design} a software architecture for your game in UML, that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{support} design elements of the game;
    		\item and \textbf{incorporate} both a client \textbf{and} a server.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement} a prototype of the client, in your language of choice, that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{illustrate} the key features of the game design.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a final prototype of the game that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present} a practical demo of the game prototype to your tutor that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{show} your academic integrity;
    		\item as well as \textbf{demonstrate} your knowledge of computer networking \textbf{and} your technical communication skills.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{programming task}. Fork the GitHub repositories at:

\url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp260-client}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{Python}, \textbf{Eclipse}, and \textbf{Visual Studio} as appropriate. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. 

To complete Part A, write about your contract in the \texttt{readme.md} document.  Show this to your tutor in-class.  If acceptable, this will be signed-off. 

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare draft versions of the computer program. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled peer-review session. Then, attend the scheduled peer-review session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part C, revise the computer program based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload it to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} three weeks after the final submission deadline.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.  The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Enough work is available to hold a meaningful discussion;
	\item Clear evidence of programming knowledge \textbf{and} communication skills;
	\item No breaches of academic integrity.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part D, prepare a practical demonstration of the computer programs. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

It is critically important that you do not neglect your individual roles in the development process. Programming in pairs means that you work together on the same computer---switching between driver and navigator. It is a great opportunity to develop your technical communication skills and overcome common misconceptions about programming. It should not, however, be treated as a 'free ride'---you will get to review each others' progress. 

A common pitfall is poor planning or time management. Often, students underestimate how much work is involved in first learning programming concepts and then actually applying them. Programming is quite unlike other subjects in that it cannot be crammed into a last minute deluge just before a deadline. It is, therefore, very important that you begin work early and sustain a consistent pace: little and often.

The first deadline is quite close to the start of the course and not much material will have been covered by this point. Please rest assured. This first formative submission is supposed to be a simple analysis of requirements. We expect there to be errors. However, it is very important to make a start on this project so you recieve early feedback to give you some direction and to encourage you to practice your programming skills across the entire duration of the course. Ideally, you should be programming every day!

The peer-review component of this work does sometimes raise alarm. However, the only way to learn how to review code is by reviewing code. Your tutor will guide you through the process and provide advice. With practice, it will become clear what is satisfactory by discussing the quality of work with your peers and your tutor during the peer review sessions. 

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
    		Falmouth University policy states that deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub. 
    		
    	\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\ 	
    		If you have discovered an issue with the brief itself, the source files are available at: \\
