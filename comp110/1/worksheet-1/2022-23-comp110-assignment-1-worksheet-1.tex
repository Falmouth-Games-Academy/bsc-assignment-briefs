\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
``The planet was a wretched wasteland, but I was so absorbed in the work that I hardly noticed. SpaceChem's reactor technology took what I had learned at university and transformed the principles of science to create new chemicals and compounds. I was enraptured by the process, which effectively amounted to alchemy.''

    \emph{SpaceChem} is a puzzle game in which players must apply computational thinking to build circuits which assemble
    chemical molecules.
}

\paragraph{
\textbf{SpaceChem} is a puzzle game released in 2011 by independent developers Zachtronics. The gameplay consists of solving problems in a visual programming environment, and as such requires many of the skills required of a programmer. This worksheet allows you to begin developing these skills, even if you are not yet comfortable with the syntax of more conventional programming languages such as Python.
}

\paragraph{
To complete this worksheet:
}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Play} SpaceChem --- it is available on the PCs in the Games Academy,
        it can be purchased from Steam for around \textsterling 7,
        or a free demo version is available;
 	\item \textbf{Complete} all of the ``research'' and ``production'' levels on the planets of Sernimir II, Sernimir IV, and Danopth.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Submission instructions}

\paragraph{
Once you have completed each level, use the in-game video recording feature to \textbf{record a video} of your solution.
Note that SpaceChem disables its video recording feature for ``defense'' levels; you do \textbf{not} need to submit videos for these.
}

\paragraph{
Locate your SpaceChem \textbf{save file} on your hard disk, for example:
}

\paragraph{
C:\textbackslash Users\textbackslash <your name>\textbackslash AppData\textbackslash Local\textbackslash Zachtronics Industries\\ \textbackslash SpaceChem\textbackslash save\textbackslash 000.user
}

\paragraph{
Go to the formative submission area for Worksheet 1 on LearningSpace.
\textbf{Upload} your save file and your video files to this submission area.
}

\section*{Stretch goals}

\paragraph{
The basic task for this worksheet is to complete \textbf{all} ``Research'' and ``Production'' levels on Sernimir II, Sernimir IV, and Danopth, except for the optional challenge level ``In-Place Swap''.
}

\paragraph{
Extra marks are available for completing one or more of the following stretch goals:
}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Solve ``Everyday is the First Day'' in 300 cycles or fewer;
		\item Solve ``It Takes Three'' in 20 symbols or fewer;
		\item Solve ``Challenge: In-Place Swap'' from Danopth, and ``An Introduction to Sensing'', ``Prelude to a Migraine'' and ``Random Oxides'' from Alkonost.
	\end{itemize}
