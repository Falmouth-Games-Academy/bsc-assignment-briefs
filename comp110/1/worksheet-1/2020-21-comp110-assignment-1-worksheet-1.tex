\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
``The planet was a wretched wasteland, but I was so absorbed in the work that I hardly noticed. SpaceChem's reactor technology took what I had learned at university and transformed the principles of science to create new chemicals and compounds. I was enraptured by the process, which effectively amounted to alchemy.''

    \emph{SpaceChem} is a puzzle game in which players must apply computational thinking to build circuits which assemble
    chemical molecules.
}

\paragraph{
\textbf{SpaceChem} is a puzzle game released in 2011 by independent developers Zachtronics. The gameplay consists of solving problems in a visual programming environment, and as such requires many of the skills required of a programmer. This worksheet allows you to begin developing these skills, even if you are not yet comfortable with the syntax of more conventional programming languages such as Python.
}

\paragraph{
To complete this worksheet:
}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Play} SpaceChem --- it is available on the PCs in the Games Academy,
        it can be purchased from Steam for around \textsterling 7,
        or a free demo version is available;
 	\item \textbf{Complete} all of the ``research'' and ``production'' levels on the planets of Sernimir II, Sernimir IV, and Danopth.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Submission instructions}

\paragraph{
Begin by \textbf{forking} the GitHub repository at the following URL:
}

\url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp110-worksheet-1}

\paragraph{
Once each level has been completed, upload a \textbf{video} of your solution to YouTube using the in-game upload feature.
Create a YouTube playlist for your videos, and add a link to it to the \texttt{README.md} file within the forked repository.
Note that SpaceChem disables its YouTube recording feature for ``defense'' levels; you do \textbf{not} need to submit videos for these.
}

\paragraph{
In addition, locate your SpaceChem save file on your hard disk, for example:
}

\paragraph{
C:\textbackslash Users\textbackslash <your name>\textbackslash AppData\textbackslash Local\textbackslash Zachtronics Industries\\ \textbackslash SpaceChem\textbackslash save\textbackslash 000.user
}

\paragraph{
\textbf{Upload} this file to your forked repository.
An automated Travis~CI script will be used to scan your save file and determine your game progress,
therefore please do \textbf{not} rename the file or upload it into a subdirectory.
}

\paragraph{
Attend the timetabled worksheet review session in \textbf{Week 2},
ensuring that you have uploaded all material to GitHub before this time.
}

\section*{Stretch goals}

\paragraph{
The basic task for this worksheet is to complete \textbf{all} ``Research'' and ``Production'' levels on Sernimir II, Sernimir IV, and Danopth, except for the optional challenge level ``In-Place Swap''.
}

\paragraph{
Extra marks are available for completing one or more of the following stretch goals:
}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Solve ``Everyday is the First Day'' in 300 cycles or fewer;
		\item Solve ``It Takes Three'' in 20 symbols or fewer;
		\item Solve ``Challenge: In-Place Swap'' from Danopth, and ``An Introduction to Sensing'', ``Prelude to a Migraine'' and ``Random Oxides'' from Alkonost.
	\end{itemize}
