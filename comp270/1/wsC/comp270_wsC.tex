\section*{Introduction}

In this worksheet you have to develop a Framework that can be used as basis to build a game or demo. This framework should use OpenGL, GLEW and SDL2.

To complete this worksheet, build an application which implements the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Intialise} SDL2
	\item \textbf{Create} a Window which can be configure with different sizes, titles and can be toggle to full screen
	\item \textbf{Create} an OpenGL Renderer
	\item \textbf{Initialises} GLEW
	\item \textbf{Runs} a Game Loop
	\item \textbf{Exits} when \textbf{escape} is pressed on the keyboard 
	\item \textbf{Cleans up} all resources when application exits
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Submission instructions}

Begin by \textbf{forking} the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp220-worksheetA}

You should complete a pull request before the hand-in on Friday by 5pm on Week 4. Feedback will be given in the pull request and in class.

\section*{Marking criteria}

Remember that \textbf{it is better to submit incomplete work than to submit nothing at all}. If you do not manage to finish all assigned task, then you can complete this before the submission of Worksheet B

To demonstrate \textbf{basic competency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Initialisation of SDL2
	\item Create of a basic Window
	\item Cleanup after exit
\end{itemize} 

To demonstrate \textbf{basic proficiency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{basic competency}
	\item Initialisation of OpenGL
	\item Initialisation of GLEW
\end{itemize}

To demonstrate \textbf{novice competency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{basic proficiency}
	\item Implement Game Loop
\end{itemize}

To demonstrate \textbf{novice proficiency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{novice competency}
	\item Application exits when key is pressed
	\item Some evidence of software design
	\item Some evidence of reusability (functions, classes, inheritance) 
\end{itemize}

To demonstrate \textbf{professional competency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{novice proficiency}
	\item Evidence of good software design (unit tests, static code analysis)
	\item Evidence of reusability (Framework is compiled into a library and can be reused)
\end{itemize}
