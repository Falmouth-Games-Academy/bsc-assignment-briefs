\section*{Introduction}

  ``There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.''

In this assignment, you will produce a journal detailing your research on computer graphics. In addition to your individual journal, as a group you will create a community wiki to collect and discuss your findings.

Familiarity with the academic literature is extremely helpful for the computing professional,
both to understand the seminal works that lay the foundations of the field,
and to keep abreast of recent developments at the cutting edge.
Games technology is a fast-moving field, and keeping up is important.
However scientific papers are written in a way that is sometimes daunting to newcomers,
so it is essential to practice the skill of reading and comprehending such papers.
Keeping a research journal is a useful way to record your thoughts
(questions, hypotheses, connections, ideas, ...) as you explore the literature.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
		\item \textbf{Write} a draft outline in the wiki, that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{Identify} the key topics to be covered by the wiki
			\item \textbf{Structure} these topics in a sensible way
		\end{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Populate} the wiki with content that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{Explain} key concepts around AI for games
			\item \textbf{Present} useful information for reference purposes
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is an \textbf{academic writing task} and \textbf{wiki task}. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp350-research-journal}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{TeX}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative}.

To complete Part A, as a class, begin populating the wiki with an outline of the topics to be covered.
Discuss and iterate upon this as a class.
It is expected that the edit log for the wiki will show that everyone has contributed to this process.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback} in class in week 3.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative}.

To complete Part B, populate the wiki with content.
Again, this is expected to be an iterative process to which everybody contributes.

Please ensure that all changes have been made to the wiki by the deadline.

To submit, clone the wiki to your local machine using Git.
Compress the wiki as a \texttt{.zip} file and upload it to the submission area on LearningSpace.
Note that although this is a collaborative assignment,
\textbf{everyone must} submit individually via LearningSpace.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

To make the most efficient use of your time,
focus your reading on papers that are relevant to the techniques you have chosen to implement
in your portfolio task for this module.
That said, it is also beneficial to read more widely around the subject area
to better understand the context within which works are situated.
As much as possible you should focus your reading on peer-reviewed scholarly sources reporting primary research:
articles in scientific workshops, conferences, journals, and some books or book chapters.
Other sources tend to be less rigorous, and should be used only for background information
or in cases where their use can be convincingly justified.

A common pitfall is to focus too much on summarising the content of the papers you have read.
For higher marks you need to demonstrate \textbf{insight} into what you have read:
forming inferences and analyses beyond what is written in the paper.
Some questions you might ask yourself are:
Why is the paper significant and/or influential?
Why did the researchers choose the approach that they did?
Is there anything counterintuitive or surprising in the paper?
Do you disagree with any of the assumptions or claims it makes?
Does the paper suggest any further research questions?

A related pitfall is to structure the journal as a sequence of disconnected entries.
Instead aim to \textbf{synthesise} multiple papers into a cohesive whole,
drawing connections between works by different authors.
Forming a holistic picture of a field is much more valuable than simply understanding individual works.

The wiki is primarily intended to become a useful shared resource for the cohort.
As such, students are expected to direct themselves and their peers in populating, structuring and editing the wiki.
If appropriate, you may copy and paste material from your individual journal into the wiki.
However note that a wiki is not a piece of academic writing
and thus will tend to have a less formal tone than you should be aiming for in your journal.
Edits may be required to ensure a consistent tone for the wiki.

You can, and indeed should, take inspiration from others' wiki contributions when working on your own journal.
However you \textbf{must not} copy verbatim material written by others;
doing so will be considered academic misconduct.

Most researchers write scientific papers for the intended audience of their fellow researchers.
Thus some papers can seem impenetrable to the novice reader.
Don't lose heart!
Discuss the paper with your peers.
Follow up the papers it cites to find alternative explanations.
If all else fails, continue reading the paper --- often a difficult paragraph is clarified by something which appears later.
