\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
``We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97\% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. ''

--- Donald Knuth

    \marginquoterule

``There is a famous rule in performance optimization called the 90/10 rule: 90\% of a program's execution time is spent in only 10\% of its code. The standard inference from this rule is that programmers should find that 10\% of the code and optimize it, because that's the only code where improvements make a difference in the overall system performance. ''

--- Richard E. Pattis

In this assignment, you are required to \textbf{optimise} a PS4 project. You will document the process and the tools you have used in a blog.

Optimisation is the process of modifying a system to make it more efficient. This will often take the form of identifying via profiling and then making a change to improve performance and then re-profiling. 

This assignment is formed of several parts:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Write} an initial blog which contains the following
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{describe} the project;
			\item \textbf{outline} the required tools;
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Review} the work of your peers
	\item \textbf{Carry out} and \textbf{document}, a series of optimisation steps
	\item \textbf{Attend} a \textbf{Viva} session
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{programming} task. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp350-optimisation}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories.
Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for platform or engine of your project.
Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

For the blog, you need to log onto the following

\indent \url{https://journal.falmouth.ac.uk}

You should be already attached to a 'class' and Blog page has already been created for you.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. Answer the following questions to pass:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the details of the project you are optimising?
	\item What tools are you going to use?
\end{itemize}

To complete Part A, prepare a blog post before \textbf{5pm on Friday of Week 2}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. You will upload your coursework repository for peer review.

You will be assessed on the following criteria 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare draft versions of the computer programs. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled peer-review session. Then, attend the scheduled peer-review session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare draft versions of the computer programs. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled sprint review sessions. Then, attend the scheduled sprint review sessions.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part D, revise your program based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload a \texttt{.zip} file to LearningSpace containing the following:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item The source code for your project;
	\item A series of blog posts which contains the following
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Description of the project
		\item Details of the profiling process
		\item Screenshots of each run of the profiler
		\item Tables/figures of each run of the profiler
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file. You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final submission deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

As always, avoid underestimating the effort required to implement even simple software; always consider scope.
From the proposal stage, you should consider very carefully what is feasible. The important aspect about this coursework is the profiling process, you should approach this like an experiment and document each step and iteration in the process.



\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
    		Falmouth University policy states that deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub. 
    		
    	\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\
