\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
``Making Doom run on a new platform is only a couple days of work,"Making it a really good game on a platform that doesn't have a keyboard and mouse or an excess of processing power is an honest development effort. ''

--- John Carmack on porting Doom to iOS

In this assignment you should \textbf{port} a project you have been working onto one of the following platforms.
\begin{itemize}
	\item PS4
	\item iOS
	\item Android
\end{itemize}

Porting a game is not a trivial task, not only do you have to account for restrictions on the platform in terms of resources but you also have to deal with the requirements of the platform holder

This assignment is formed of several parts:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Carry out} and \textbf{document} your porting process
	\item \textbf{Review} the work of your peers
	\item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual}, a practical demo of the computer program to your tutor that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
			\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
			\item as well as \textbf{demonstrate} your \textbf{individual} programming knowledge \textbf{and} communication skills.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{programming} task. Continue on with the repository from Assignment or fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp350-porting}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories.
Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for platform or engine of your project.
Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. Answer the following questions to pass:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the details of the project you are optimising?
	\item What language/engine are you optimising?
	\item What tools are you going to use?
\end{itemize}

To complete Part A, prepare a blog post which answers the above questions.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. You will upload your coursework repository for peer review.

You will be assessed on the following criteria 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare draft versions of the computer programs. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled peer-review session. Then, attend the scheduled peer-review session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare draft versions of the computer programs. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled sprint review sessions. You should also ensure that your Blog is up to date.  Then, attend the scheduled sprint review sessions.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part D, revise your program based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload a \texttt{.zip} file to LearningSpace containing the following:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item The source code for your project;
	\item A \textbf{readme.md} which has URL to your Dev Blog
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Additional Guidance}

As always, avoid underestimating the effort required to implement even simple software; always consider scope.
From the proposal stage, you should consider very carefully what is feasible. The important aspect about this coursework is the profiling process, you should approach this like an experiment and document each step and iteration in the process.



\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
    		Falmouth University policy states that deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub. 
    		
    	\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\
