    A demo of fluid simulation with NVIDIA's PhysX.
    Recent advances in GPU technology have enabled a wide range of high-fidelity real-time rendering and simulation effects.
}

In this assignment, you are required to \textbf{design} and \textbf{implement} a C++ program using SDL and OpenGL
which demonstrates the type of 3D computer graphics techniques that appear in a modern game engine.

Graphics technology is one of the most obvious areas in which innovation has driven gaming technology in recent years.
Modern gaming PCs and consoles contain powerful graphics processing units (GPUs),
and gamers expect modern games to push this hardware to its full potential.
In this assignment you will practice the use of advanced graphical effects.
Your final product will be a portfolio piece, which you can use in future to demonstrate your mastery of these techniques.

This assignment is formed of several parts:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Write} a 2-page handout that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{outline} the concept of your demo;
			\item \textbf{explain} how your demo satisfies the requirements of the contract (provided as an appendix at the end of this document);
			\item \textbf{describe} at least \textbf{two} graphical or simulation effects your demo will include;
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Populate} a Trello board with the user stories for your demo.
	\item \textbf{Implement}, over a series of \textbf{three} sprints, draft versions of your program that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{address} the requirements in the contract;
			\item \textbf{implement} at least \textbf{two} algorithms for graphical or simulation effects.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Implement} a final version of your program, which will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Present} a practical demo of the computer program to your tutor that will:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
			\item \textbf{demonstrate} your individual programming knowledge and communication skills.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{programming} task. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp220-portfolio}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories.
Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{Visual Studio}.
Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. Answer the following questions to pass:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the title and high concept of the demo?
	\item What is the intended aesthetic?
	\item For each of two graphical or simulation effects:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What is the effect?
		\item How will the effect contribute to the aesthetic?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Is the scope appropriate for the product development time-frame?
\end{itemize}

To complete Part A, prepare the handout using any word processing tool.
To help illustrate your intended aesthetic, your handout may include images and/or links to online videos.
In addition, create a Trello board and populate it with your user stories.

Show the handout to your \textbf{tutor} for immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare draft versions of the computer programs. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled sprint review sessions. Then, attend the scheduled sprint review sessions.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part D, revise the computer program based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload it to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} three weeks after the final submission deadline.

\subsection*{Part E}

Part E is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.  The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Enough work is available to hold a meaningful discussion;
	\item Clear evidence of programming knowledge \textbf{and} communication skills;
	\item No breaches of academic integrity.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part E, prepare a practical demonstration of the computer program. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

As always, avoid underestimating the effort required to implement even simple software; always consider scope.
From the proposal stage, you should consider very carefully what is feasible.

Your code will be assessed on \textbf{functional coherence}:
how well the finished product corresponds to the user stories,
and whether it has any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.

Unlike your previous assignments,
you will be assessed on the \textbf{performance} of your solution.
Real-time graphics and simulation are not just about creating aesthetically pleasing effects,
but doing so whilst maintaining a smooth and consistent framerate free of any lag or glitches that might frustrate the player.
It may be necessary to trade-off the complexity or fidelity of an effect
in order to achieve acceptable performance.

Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, libraries, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for complexity  
where something simpler would have sufficed.

\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve code comprehension,
and carefully choose the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
Use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation}.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
Consider allowing some literal values, where appropriate, to be ``tinkered'' without changing the source code,
e.g.\ by defining them in an external file read at startup.

As with all assignments on this course, you are expected to display a level of
\textbf{innovation and creative flair} befitting Falmouth University's reputation as a world-leading
arts institution.
One approach to promoting creativity is
\textbf{divergent thinking}: generating ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
Often the most interesting ideas are \textbf{subversive}: they deliberately go against
convention or obvious solutions.

You will \textbf{not} be judged on the quality of your art assets.
It is fine to use meshes and textures found online,
as long as they are available under an appropriate license and are properly attributed.

\section*{FAQ}
