\section*{Introduction}

You will prepare and pitch a pre-production prototype of a game-related product. You can: (i) join a  BA team as a `technical specialist' to work on one specific game component; (ii) join many BA teams as `consultant' to work with one particular emerging technology; (iii) join a BSc team to make a game that serves as a tech demo for cutting-edge game components; or (iv) work in any configuration (including individual) to develop a game-making tool or game middleware that another BA/BSc team could make use of. Use any programming language or technology the Games Academy has access to.

Gaming is a diverse ecology. Experiencing different roles and cross-disciplinary challenges is important. Computing professionals frequently encounter them.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write}, as an \textbf{individual}, a 2-page handout that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{outline} a product concept \textbf{and} target market;
    		\item \textbf{state} your intended \textbf{individual} contribution;
    		\item and \textbf{justify} a business case for the product overall.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual}, a 3-minute `elevator pitch', which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} the product concept contained in your handout;
    		\item and \textbf{illustrate why} someone should invest in your product.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as a \textbf{group}, a plan, which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    	    	\item \textbf{identify} the skills and time available to complete pre-production;
    	    	\item \textbf{iterate} upon \textbf{and improve} the design of the product;
    		\item \textbf{describe} the key user stories that comprise the requirements;
    		\item and \textbf{highlight} the stories that will comprise a minimal viable product.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, an initial pre-production prototype of the product which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{illustrate} the product's core features and unique selling points.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, a final pre-production prototype of the product which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write}, as a \textbf{group}, a presentation slide-deck and 2-page handout which:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{outlines} the core features and unique selling points;
    		\item and \textbf{justifies} the business case for the product overall.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as a \textbf{group}, a 15-minute `investment pitch` that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{product development task}. Fork the GitHub repositories at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp230-pre-production}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for your language of choice. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\todo[inline]{If you are not working with other BSc students, you are a group of one. As such, all references to group, collaborative, and/or teamwork activities refer to yourself as an individual. Involving BA students in such activites is optional.}

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. Answer the following questions to pass:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What is the product?
	\item Is there a market? Who is the target audience?
	\item What are the unique selling points?
	\item Is the scope appropriate for the product development time-frame?
\end{itemize}

To complete Part A, prepare the handout using any word processing tool. There is no submission.

Show the handout to your \textbf{tutor} for immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Presentation is timely;
	\item The product concept can be understood;
	\item Proposed product concept will likely lead to a feasible product design.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, practice the delivery of the presentation. Ensure that you are comfortable with the presentation medium and discuss any concerns with your tutor. Then, attend the scheduled elevator pitch session. Also, please ensure that you bring a sufficient number of copies of your handout to the session.

A formal presentation slide-deck (i.e. PowerPoint) is \textbf{not permitted}. However, additional visual, tactile, auditory, and/or olfactory aids are acceptable.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from \textbf{tutors} and \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Only well-formed user stories are included;
	\item The plan is comprehensive;
	\item The plan is feasible.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, setup and populate the team Trello board. Ensure that all members of the team are added to the board. Show it to your tutor in the scheduled personal catch-up tutorial.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part D}

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Avoid poor planning and time management. By now this will be a familiar phrase, but it is no less true.
In particular, avoid underestimating the effort required to implement even simple software; always consider scope.
From the pitch stage, you should consider very carefully what is feasible.

For the most part, your work will be marked as a group effort.
However we want to avoid the situation where students try to ``coast'' through the assignment
on their fellow group members' work,
and equally the situation where one member of the group takes the lion's share of the work
and prevents the others from contributing effectively.
Marks will be weighted by a multiplier for \textbf{individual contribution},
which aims to penalise both of these behaviours.
We assess this by several means, including but not limited to: sprint reviews; individual vivas; feedback from your peers;
attribution in the source code; and GitHub commit logs.
Any student who has contributed their \textit{fair share} of effort to the project will receive a fair \% for their effort,
so any student who is putting in the appropriate level of effort has no need to worry.
Note that effort is not the same as productivity.

The first step in planning your implementation should be to break your concept down into \textbf{user stories}. 
Your user stories should be \textbf{distinguishable} (i.e.\ there should be little overlap between them)
and \textbf{easily measured} (i.e.\ it should be easy to tell when each user story has been implemented).
They should also be \textbf{comprehensive}, i.e.\ the user stories should completely capture the
desired functionality of the game, with no gaps.
Imagine giving your user stories to a developer who has never seen a product of this type before.
Would they be able to implement the software correctly, or would they miss key features?

%Wherever possible, you should clearly \textbf{attribute} the author(s) of segments of your code.
%The easiest way to do this is by inserting appropriate comments, for example:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%/* This function was written by student 1511111 */
%\end{lstlisting}
%\begin{lstlisting}
%/* This function was pair-programmed by students 1522222 and 1533333 */
%\end{lstlisting}
%\begin{lstlisting}
%/* This function was adapted by student 1544444 from an example at http://stackoverflow.com/a/1657490 */
%\end{lstlisting}

Your code will be assessed on \textbf{functional coherence}:
how well the finished product corresponds to the user stories,
and whether it has any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.

Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, libraries, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for complexity  
where something simpler would have sufficed.

\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve code comprehension,
and carefully choose the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
Use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation}.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
Consider allowing some literal values, where appropriate, to be ``tinkered'' without changing the source code,
e.g.\ by defining them in an external file read at startup.

As with all assignments on this course, you are expected to display a level of
\textbf{innovation and creative flair} befitting Falmouth University's reputation as a world-leading
arts institution.
We are looking for creativity; but, 
you will \textbf{not} be judged on the quality of your art assets.
One approach to promoting creativity is
\textbf{divergent thinking}: generating ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
Often the most interesting ideas are \textbf{subversive}: they deliberately go against
convention or obvious solutions.
