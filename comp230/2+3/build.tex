\section*{Introduction}

You will prepare a pre-production prototype of a game-related product. You will work with peers drawn from other courses in the Games Academy in a team. You will be involved in ideation, but will primarily adopt a role as a `technical specialist' to develop game components and facilitate play-testing.

Game development is a diverse ecology. Tackling the challenges of multidisciplinarity is important---notably, appreciating the roles of computing experts.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual}, a 10-minute `world pitch' that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describe} an original world;
    		\item and \textbf{reveal affordances} to be leveraged as the context for a game.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as a \textbf{group}, a 20-minute `game concept pitch' that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{extend} the world that you devised and/or those devised by peers;
    		\item \textbf{illustrate} the key concept of the game;
    		\item and \textbf{justify} a business case for the game.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, a pre-production prototype that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{illustrate} the core gameplay and unique selling points;
    		\item and \textbf{facilitate} play testing.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as a \textbf{group}, a video of the pre-production prototype that:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{highlights} the key features of the game;
    		\item and \textbf{responds} to issues identified during play-testing.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual}, a 3-minute `business case` and demo that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} the gameplay and its design;
    		\item and \textbf{demonstrate} the final pre-production prototype.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Demonstrate}, as a \textbf{group}, the pre-production prototype:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
    		\item as well as \textbf{showcase EACH} of your individual contributions.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{product development task}. 

You will need to devise an approach to communication, task management, and version control with your peers. Strive to be as adaptable as possible and heed the advise of your product owner.

You may use any languages, tools, and development environment available within the Games Academy.

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part A, devise an original world. Then, prepare a slide-deck and handout that describe that world. You will either: (i) present these as a live 10-minute presentation to tutors; or (ii) record a 10-minute video. Attend the relevant sessions and then upload your materials to the LearningSpace.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} 3-weeks after the deadline.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part B, devise an game concept with your peers. You are expected to build upon the worlds of one or more members of your team, amalgamating ideas where neccessary. Prepare a slide-deck and handout that describe your game concept. You will either: (i) present these as a live 10-minute presentation to tutors; or (ii) record a 10-minute video. Attend the relevant sessions and then upload your materials to the LearningSpace.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} 3-weeks after the deadline.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Playable builds are made available in a timely manner;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare draft versions of the pre-production prototype ahead of the \textbf{sprint review meetings} with your product owner. Ensure that the source code and related assets are made available prior to \textbf{EACH} scheduled meeting. Then, attend the scheduled meetings.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{product owner}.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part D, revise the pre-production prototype based on the feedback you have received through play-testing, crits, and your product owner. Then record a a 5-minute video of the gameplay implemented in the pre-production prototype. The video should showcase the core elements of the game and draw attention to the evolution of the design; particularly from play-testing. Fading through a few different versions of the build is a possibility. Upload the video to the LearningSpace. In addition, as a supplementary, provide a source code excerpts for your specialist contributions.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\subsection*{Part E}

Part E is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item The title and high concept of the product
	\item The target audience and market
	\item The concept's unique selling points and how they distinguish it from competitors
	\item The design's technical and production feasibility
	\item The project's commercial feasibility
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part E, prepare a rough handout and elevator pitch. Practice the delivery of the presentation to ensure it fits within the time constraint. Ensure that you are comfortable with the demonstrating your work and discuss any concerns with your tutor. Then, attend the demo session after the winter break.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part F}

Part F is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work has both \textbf{individual} and \textbf{collaborative} elements and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item A working and playable build is presented;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item Individual contributions are both clearly articulated and explained.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part F, prepare a live demonstration of the pre-production prototype. You are permitted to demo any version of the pre-production prototype, but it must be a playable and working version. Then, attend the scheduled demo-day.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Avoid poor planning and time management. By now this will be a familiar phrase, but it is no less true.
In particular, avoid underestimating the effort required to implement even simple software; always consider scope.
From the pitch stage, you should consider very carefully what is feasible.

For the most part, your work will be marked as a group effort.
However we want to avoid the situation where students try to ``coast'' through the assignment
on their fellow group members' work,
and equally the situation where one member of the group takes the lion's share of the work
and prevents the others from contributing effectively.
Marks will be weighted by a multiplier for \textbf{individual contribution},
which aims to penalise both of these behaviours.
We assess this by several means, including but not limited to: sprint reviews; individual vivas; feedback from your peers;
attribution in the source code; and commit logs.
Any student who has contributed their \textit{fair share} of effort to the project will receive a fair \% for their effort,
so any student who is putting in the appropriate level of effort has no need to worry.
Note that effort is not the same as productivity.

The first step in planning your implementation should be to break your concept down into \textbf{user stories}. 
Your user stories should be \textbf{distinguishable} (i.e.\ there should be little overlap between them)
and \textbf{easily measured} (i.e.\ it should be easy to tell when each user story has been implemented).
They should also be \textbf{comprehensive}, i.e.\ the user stories should completely capture the
desired functionality of the game, with no gaps.
Imagine giving your user stories to a developer who has never seen a product of this type before.
Would they be able to implement the software correctly, or would they miss key features?

Your game will be assessed on \textbf{conceptual coherence} and \textbf{player engagement}. This loosely corresponds to the \textbf{functional coherence} criterion you have previously been familiar with:
how well the finished product corresponds to the user stories,
and whether it has any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.
However, the strength of the concept and its ability to engage players are integrated into the definition. It mustn't just work---it should also be fun!

Your source code will also be assessed as part of your \textbf{specialist contribution}. This is a single criterion consisting of \textbf{both sophistication and maintainability}.
Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, libraries, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for complexity  
where something simpler would have sufficed.
\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve code comprehension,
and carefully choose the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
Use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation}.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
Consider allowing some literal values, where appropriate, to be ``tinkered'' without changing the source code,
e.g.\ by defining them in an external file read at startup.
