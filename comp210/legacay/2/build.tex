}

In this assignment, you are required to design and develop an interface that incorporates either augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR). The interface should function as a means of interacting with the game your team are developing for the COMP230 - Game Development I: Pre-Production module. You may decide that you want to develop a new concept, separate from the work being carried out for COMP230. In this case, you will need to negotiate the potential outcome with the module coordinator. You will have access to a variety of AR/VR peripherals that can be incorporated into your project or you can develop your own. If you already have access to related hardware that you would like to work with this is also acceptable. 

In the games industry, emerging technology have a tendency to disrupt our practice on a regular basis. As a developer it is vital that you are able to adapt and move with the times. What is trending now will soon become industry norms and make way for new innovations. It is easy to become overwhelmed by the pace of technological change that our industry faces. This module aims to encourage you to embrace this tide of technology advancement, using experimentation, tinkering and play to make sense of new technologies and channel your inner creativity rather than frustration. 

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write}, a proposal for a VR/AR interface that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{state and justify} the game that will be the basis for your interface;
		\item \textbf{assess} VR/AR market;
		\item \textbf{outline} an initial design in detail;
		\item and \textbf{list} the key requirements the prototype must fulfil.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{design} and \textbf{Implement} your interface:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
		\item \textbf{improve} upon the design iteratively over the course of six weeks;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement} a final interface which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
		\item \textbf{revise} the design based on the results of the peer evaluation session.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present} a practical demo of the game controller to your tutor that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
    		\item as well as \textbf{show} your programming knowledge \textbf{and} communication skills.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

Fork the GitHub repository at:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp210-vr-ar-interface }

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{whichever} language you have chosen to implement your interface in. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Choice of interface is feasible;
	\item research is comprehensive;
	\item Design is distinctive and has creative merit.
\end{enumerate}

To complete part A, write your proposal in the \texttt{readme.md} document. Show this to your tutor in-class. If acceptable, this will be signed-off.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is formed of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This is \textbf{individual} work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough progress is made to conduct a meaningful review each week;
	\item A broadly appropriate evaluation of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, implement your interface utilising a fast, iterative development process. Demonstrate your progress to your tutor each week in class. Ensure that any digital artefacts (including but not limited to design sketches, photographs, art assets, source code, electronic circuit designs) are pushed to GitHub prior to each weekly session. Also ensure that you bring your prototype with you each week. 

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} and \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part C, revise the interface design based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload photos and source code to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} three weeks after the final submission deadline.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This is \textbf{individual} work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Enough work is available to hold a meaningful discussion; 
	\item Clear evidence of programming knowledge and communication skills; 
	\item No breaches of academic integrity. 
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part D, prepare a practical demonstration of the interface. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session. 

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal} feedback from your \textbf{tutor}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}
Falmouth University is internationally renowned for the arts. Despite the fact that you are studying for a BSc degree in a technical discipline, you are still expected to strive for the same level of innovation and creative flair as your peers. This assignment is more heavily weighted towards the creative than the assignments you have completed thus far. On this assignment, a competent execution of an unimaginative idea is unlikely to achieve a high grade, as opposed to an imperfect execution of a unique and ambitious concept, which will be seen favourably by examiners. Consider this when working on your design. One approach to promote creativity is divergent thinking: generate ideas by exploring many possible solutions. Often the most interesting ideas are subversive: they deliberately go against the accepted or most obvious solution.

Whichever platform you choose, you may implement your component in C++, C\#, Python, or a combination of these. Other languages may be permitted at the discretion of your tutor, if you can argue convincingly that it is appropriate for the proposed project. The design of your interface must be informed by the usability and user-experience findings from assignment one. 

The development process for your interface should be fast and iterative. In the first five weeks you will journey through the stages of discovery, interpretation and ideation. This will be followed by six weeks of prototyping through fast paced experimentation and evolution. At the end of each ?prototyping? week you should aim to have a fully functional prototype that has been improved considerably from the previous week. 

Most VR/AR headset and peripheral manufacturers release their products with SDKs, plugins and game engine integration. This helps developers utilise these products in their own projects with ease. For this assignment you must not rely on the basic examples and demos given away for free with the developer kits.  You are expected to produce new code alongside using the appropriate libraries or plugins to create an interface that is unique, novel and innovative. 

Stand on the shoulders of giants. Although you may be new to developing for AR/VR these types of systems have been around since the 1960s. In fact, stereoscopic photo viewers have been around since 1838 (see Charles Wheatstone). Large organisations such as Google, Facebook and many others are all investing massive sums of money in research, production and documentation for VR and AR. There is a wealth of information already out there that you will need to draw upon to create a successful response to the assignment. 

You should aim to demonstrate a high level of sophistication in the technical execution of your prototype. An important part of sophistication is having the insight to choose the right tool for the job: if a simpler technique fulfils all the requirements, use it. The use of unnecessarily complicated techniques, serving only to showcase one's own cleverness, is a dangerous habit. 

The sole purpose of the recorded demonstration is to aid the external moderators and examiners. Furthermore, any photos and/or videos submitted do not need to be entertaining or highly polished.
