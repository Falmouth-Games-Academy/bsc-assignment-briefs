\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you will evaluate an existing screen-based game interface of your choice, with a focus on usability and user-experience. You will carry out at least two distinct methods of evaluation: qualitative and quantitative.

Human-centred design (HCD) methods not only put the player at the heart of the design process, but also focuses on their experience of the game. It relies on fast-paced iteration, where evaluation and testing are performed at each stage. This allows the designer to learn from each iteration and feed-forward into the next. Familiarising yourself with such methods will inform your design practice, helping you to make games with better interactivity.  

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Set up} a GitHub Pages website \textbf{and modify} the HTML/CSS code that defines the website, such that you: 
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{manipulate} the default layout to personalise the site;
    		\item and \textbf{justify} your choice of screen-based game interface.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Evaluate} a screen-based game interface, ensuring that you:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{critically reflect} on your choice of evaluation methods;
		\item \textbf{note} your findings, in detail, on your GitHub Pages site.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present} a 10-minute summary of your findings that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{justify} your choice of evaluation methods;
    		\item \textbf{describe} the strengths \textbf{and} weaknesses of your chosen interface;
    		\item \textbf{recommend how} usability \textbf{and} user experience can be improved;
    		\item and \textbf{explain} the limitations of your chosen evaluation methods.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Incorporate} your conclusions \textbf{and} recommendations into your GitHub Pages site, ensuring that it will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.		
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is an \textbf{usability evaluation task}. Fork the GitHub repository at:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp210-evaluation}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{HTML}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A is formed of \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item The website is live and can be accessed through a web browser;
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, follow the GitHub Pages tutorial and setup a site on your GitHub account.  Modify the content and default template to incorporate your own HTML and CSS code. Demonstrate this to your tutor.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is formed of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough progress is made to conduct a meaningful review each week;
	\item At least one qualitative and one quantitative method is applied.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, carry out a thorough evaluation of your chosen interface. Then, document your process and findings using GitHub pages. Ensure that any digital artefacts (including but not limited to sketches, photographs, diagrams, raw data, and any other documentation) are included in your GitHub page. Although some written discussion will be necessary, do not overly rely on this mode of communication. Instead, experiment with embedding dynamic content such as visualisations, images and videos. Demonstrate your progress to your tutor in each session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Enough work is available to hold a meaningful discussion; 
	\item Clear evidence of usability testing knowledge and communication skills; 
	\item No breaches of academic integrity. 
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, prepare a ten minute presentation based on around your GitHub documentation page that explains your approach to the task, summarises your findings and recommendations, as well as the limitations of your evaluation method. Ensure that all related assets are pushed to the GitHub Pages site prior to the scheduled peer-review session. Then, attend the scheduled peer-review session. 

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal} feedback from your \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part D, revise the GitHub Pages site based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload the GitHub Pages site to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} three weeks after the final submission deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Your choice of game interface should not only be complex and interesting enough to warrant interrogation but also be relevant to your interests and your aspirations as a game developer. The selection process might involve choosing multiple games and using rapid and heavily discounted evaluation methods to identify the game interface that will produce the most insightful results. Before you begin the task you are encouraged to research existing case studies and evaluations to inform your approach. 

Your evaluation must find a balance between expert reviews and usability testing. Human-centred design (HCD) puts the user at the centre of the design process, and thus relying solely on expert reviews will not produce results conducive to a HCD process. The purpose of usability testing is to evaluate the user's behaviour when interacting with an interface and identify the aspects of the interface that are most regularly a source of frustration and confusion. Tests should be designed around tasks and scenarios that represent typical end-user goals. Participants in your studies must span a range of skills and experiences for your results to be meaningful. It is important that you go beyond your course cohort to find participants. 

You should use a range of qualitative and quantitative methods of evaluation. Some suggested methods are: cognitive walkthrough; task analysis; user-story mapping; analytic tools. Many other methods can be found in the academic literature.

GitHub Pages are an invaluable tool for showcasing your work to future employers and collaborators. You will use them a lot more in the third year so it is important that you familiarise yourself with them now. GitHub Pages are created just like any other website, using HTML to layout content, CSS to control the style and JavaScript to create dynamic behaviour such as animations and interactive components. Although you have not been taught these specific languages, your existing knowledge of document markup languages such as LaTeX and programming languages such as Python and C++, combined with the wealth of tutorials available online, should make it relatively easy to pick these languages up.

Poor planning and poor time management can have a significant impact on this assignment. A comprehensive evaluation cannot be `crammed' into a last minute deluge. Sustain a steady pace across the four weeks. Aim to implement one method of evaluation per week.

Areas where students tend to lose marks are: depth of insight; analytical skill; and evaluative skill. Depth of insight implies rigorous testing of each task in detail. Adequate analysis implies going beyond mere description, perhaps through: researching UI/UX, comparing interfaces, and deploying reasoning to generate new insights. Adequate evaluation implies making appropriate reference to evidence and ensuring that evidence is of appropriate quality. Further to this, sound and valid arguments should be constructed based on common usability principles.
