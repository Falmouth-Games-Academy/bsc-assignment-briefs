    The terminal hacking minigame in \emph{Fallout 4}.
}

The open-world RPG \textbf{Fallout~4} contains a terminal hacking minigame, in which
the player must guess a secret $n$-letter word.
In this worksheet, you will model this minigame using a flowchart and a piece of pseudocode.

In the minigame, each guess receives a \textbf{likeness} score,
defined as the number of letters which match the secret word (i.e.\ the same letter in the same position).
For example if the secret word is \texttt{HOUSE} and the guess is \texttt{MOUSE}, the likeness is $4$ out of $5$.
If the guess is \texttt{HOPES}, the likeness is $2$ out of $5$
(the letters \texttt{S} and \texttt{E} do not count as they are in the wrong positions).
The minigame ends when the player guesses correctly, or after four incorrect guesses.
(In Fallout~4 there is a way to replenish the number of available guesses,
but this is disregarded in this worksheet for simplicity.)

To complete this worksheet:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Write} a piece of pseudocode which, given the secret word and the guessed word,
		calculates and displays the similarity score.
	\item \textbf{Draw} a flowchart for the overall minigame.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Submission instructions}

If you did not already do so for Worksheet A, \textbf{fork} the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp110-worksheets}

Within the \url{worksheet_B} directory (which you should create if it does not exist),
write your \textbf{pseudocode} in the \texttt{README.md} file.
Upload your \textbf{flowchart} as an image, and embed it in the \texttt{README.md} file also.
Open a \textbf{pull request}.

You may use any tool you wish to produce your flowchart,
be it a software tool or pen and paper.
If you use pen and paper, please scan your flowchart and upload it to GitHub;
scanning facilities are available in the library and elsewhere on campus.

Attend the scheduled worksheet feedback session on \textbf{Monday October 10th 2016},
ensuring that you have uploaded all material to GitHub and opened a pull request before this time.

\section*{Marking criteria}

Remember that \textbf{it is better to submit incomplete work than to submit nothing at all}.
Any attempt, even unfinished, at producing a flowchart and a piece of pseudocode will receive a passing grade.

Your work will be marked according to the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Are your flowchart and pseudocode \textbf{clear} and \textbf{comprehensive}?
	\item Is your formatting \textbf{readable} and \textbf{consistent}?
	\item Have you chosen an appropriate level of \textbf{abstraction}?
	\item In your pseudocode, have you used appropriate \textbf{identifier names} and \textbf{comments}?
\end{itemize}

Please note that you are \textbf{not} being assessed on the presentation quality of your flowchart,
so please do not spend undue time and effort on using advanced drawing software to lay out your flowchart.
A hand-drawn and scanned flowchart will suffice.
