In this assignment, you are required to \textbf{design} and \textbf{implement} a C++ program using SDL and OpenGL
which demonstrates the type of 3D computer graphics techniques that appear in a modern game engine.

Graphics technology is one of the most obvious areas in which innovation has driven gaming technology in recent years.
Modern gaming PCs and consoles contain powerful graphics processing units (GPUs),
and gamers expect modern games to push this hardware to its full potential.
In this assignment you will practice the use of advanced graphical effects.
Your final product will be a portfolio piece, which you can use in future to demonstrate your mastery of these techniques.

For this assignment you have to carry out the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implement an application framework using SDL
	\item Initialise OpenGL
	\item Render multiple 3D Object to the screen
	\item Scene lit with at lease one light
	\item FPS style Camera which can be controlled by the user
\end{itemize}

You have to submit a zip file which contains your application source code and all assets to the learning space by \textbf{4pm on 22nd of March 2018}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{programming} task. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp220-portfolio}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories.
Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{Visual Studio}.
Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\section*{Additional Guidance}

As always, avoid underestimating the effort required to implement even simple software; always consider scope.
From the proposal stage, you should consider very carefully what is feasible.

Your code will be assessed on \textbf{functional coherence}:
how well the finished product corresponds to the user stories,
and whether it has any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.

Unlike your previous assignments,
you will be assessed on the \textbf{performance} of your solution.
Real-time graphics and simulation are not just about creating aesthetically pleasing effects,
but doing so whilst maintaining a smooth and consistent framerate free of any lag or glitches that might frustrate the player.
It may be necessary to trade-off the complexity or fidelity of an effect
in order to achieve acceptable performance.

Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, libraries, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for complexity  
where something simpler would have sufficed.

\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve code comprehension,
and carefully choose the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
Use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation}.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
Consider allowing some literal values, where appropriate, to be ``tinkered'' without changing the source code,
e.g.\ by defining them in an external file read at startup.

As with all assignments on this course, you are expected to display a level of
\textbf{innovation and creative flair} befitting Falmouth University's reputation as a world-leading
arts institution.
One approach to promoting creativity is
\textbf{divergent thinking}: generating ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
Often the most interesting ideas are \textbf{subversive}: they deliberately go against
convention or obvious solutions.

You will \textbf{not} be judged on the quality of your art assets.
It is fine to use meshes and textures found online,
as long as they are available under an appropriate license and are properly attributed.

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
    		Falmouth University policy states that deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub. 
    		
    	\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\
