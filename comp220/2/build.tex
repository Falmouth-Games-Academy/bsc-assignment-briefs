In this assignment, you will produce a Mathematics library which can be used by a Computer Graphics API such as OpenGL. You will work as a class to contribute to the creation of this library and build on it over the course of the module. To aid in the development of the library you will also create a wiki and also produce code documentation in the doxygen format - \url{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}.

You will also need to read and understand academic and non-academic sources in order to build this library. This research should be documented in the wiki and pages developed to support the synthesis of the source material. 

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft plan in the wiki for the library, that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{write} User Stories for the library
    		\item \textbf{list} the key sources to support the library.
    		\item \textbf{list} a series of Unit Tests to be carried out during the development of the library
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Develop} the first draft of the library, this should include the key classes/functions for the library
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{summarise} the key features of the library;
    		\item \textbf{write} entries in the wiki to support these key components of the library
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
    		\item \textbf{detail} the results of the Unit tests
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Develop} the final draft of the library
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{summarise} the key features of the library;
    		\item \textbf{write} entries in the wiki to support these key components of the library
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
    		\item \textbf{complete} a peer assessment
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Discuss} your contribution to the wiki \& library with your tutor in the viva session in class.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is an \textbf{development} and \textbf{wiki task}. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp220-maths-lib}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{Visual Studio}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

A Trello board has also been setup, please ensure that you visit the following link to become a member - \url{https://trello.com/invite/b/fAFs8G9h/f3f7671ef0511c139dc00715e229e002/comp220-maths-library-2017-18}

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{collaborative}.

Please ensure that you have added all User Stories to the Trello board. Any discussion on the generation of this should be evident on the history of the wiki page for the features of the library.

The key sources should be added to a \textbf{sources page} on the wiki, again this should be a collaborative effort and it should be evident from the history of the page (and discussion) that everyone has contributed to this.

The Unit tests should be detailed on a \textbf{testing card} on the Trello board and these should be given more detail on a wiki page called \textbf{testing}.

Please ensure that all changes have been made to wiki and pull request has been made by the \textbf{end of week 3}. 

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{collaborative}.

To complete Part B, you should carry out a first pass implementation of the library. At this point key classes such as Vectors and Matrices should be created, in addition to these classes then some of the key operations should also be implemented such as addition, multiplication, dot product, cross product etc. All code written at this point should be fully commented in the Doxygen style, these doscs should also be uploaded to a wikipage called \textbf{docs} 

The results of Unit tests should be detailed on the \textbf{testing} wiki page.

Please ensure that all changes have been made to wiki and pull request has been made by week 6. 

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C consists of a \textbf{single formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{collaborative}.

To complete Part C, you should update the maths library to include more functionality such as a class to support Quaternions.

The results of Unit tests should be detailed on the \textbf{testing} wiki page.

Please ensure that all changes have been made to wiki and pull request has been made by week 10. 

Finally, you should fill out a peer assessment for each student in the class.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part D, bring the final version of the library to the viva session in class.
Be ready to discuss your work with your tutor.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback}.
