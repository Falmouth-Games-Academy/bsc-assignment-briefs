In this assignment, you will produce a Mathematics library which can be used by a Computer Graphics API such as OpenGL. You will work as a class to contribute to the creation of this library and build on it over the course of the module. To aid in the development of the library you will also create a wiki and also produce code documentation in the doxygen format - \url{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}.

You will also need to read and understand academic and non-academic sources in order to build this library. This research should be documented in the wiki and pages developed to support the synthesis of the source material. 

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft plan in the wiki for the library, that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{Write} User Stories for the library
    		\item \textbf{list} the key sources to support the library.
    		\item \textbf{list} a series of Unit Tests to be carried out during the development of the library
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Develop} the first draft of the library, this should include the key classes/functions for the library
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{summarise} the key features of the library;
    		\item \textbf{write} entries in the wiki to support these key components of the library
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
    		\item \textbf{detail} the results of the Unit tests
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Develop} the final draft of the library
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{summarise} the key features of the library;
    		\item \textbf{write} entries in the wiki to support these key components of the library
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Discuss} your contribution to the wiki \& library with your tutor in the viva session in class.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is an \textbf{development} and \textbf{wiki task}. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp220-maths-lib}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{Visual Studio}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

A Trello board has also been setup, please ensure that you visit the following link to become a member - \url{https://trello.com/invite/b/fAFs8G9h/f3f7671ef0511c139dc00715e229e002/comp220-maths-library-2017-18}

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

Please ensure that you have added all User Stories to the Trello board. Any discussion on the generation of this should be evident on the history of the wiki page for the features of the library.

The key sources should be added to a \textbf{sources page} on the wiki, again this should be a collaborative effort and it should be evident from the history of the page (and discussion) that everyone has contributed to this.

The Unit tests should be detailed on a \textbf{testing card} on the Trello board and these should be given more detail on a wiki page called \text{testing}.

Please ensure that all changes have been made to wiki and pull request has been made by week 3. 

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis
using the criteria listed in the marking rubric at the end of this document.

To complete Part B, revise your report from Part~A to take into account any feedback you have received so far.

Compress your \texttt{readme.md} file, along with any required images or other external files,
into a \texttt{.zip} file and upload it to LearningSpace.
Alternatively, if you have used LaTeX, upload a \texttt{.pdf} file of your journal to LearningSpace.
Note that LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} or \texttt{.pdf} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C consists of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{individual} but with a \textbf{collaborative} component, and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis.
The criterion used to assess this part relates to the quantity and quality of your contributions.

To complete Part C, contribute to the wiki at the following URL:

\url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp220-journal/wiki}

Please ensure that you are editing the wiki for the \texttt{Falmouth-Games-Academy} repository,
and \textbf{not} the wiki for your fork of the repository.

During your personal tutor meetings, make your tutor aware of your contributions to the wiki.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback} as well as \textbf{ongoing peer feedback}.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part D, bring the final version of your research journal to the viva session in class.
Be ready to discuss your work with your tutor.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

To make the most efficient use of your time,
focus your reading on papers that are relevant to the techniques you have chosen to implement
in your portfolio task for this module.
That said, it is also beneficial to read more widely around the subject area
to better understand the context within which works are situated.
As much as possible you should focus your reading on peer-reviewed scholarly sources reporting primary research:
articles in scientific workshops, conferences, journals, and some books or book chapters.
Other sources tend to be less rigorous, and should be used only for background information
or in cases where their use can be convincingly justified.

A common pitfall is to focus too much on summarising the content of the papers you have read.
For higher marks you need to demonstrate \textbf{insight} into what you have read:
forming inferences and analyses beyond what is written in the paper.
Some questions you might ask yourself are:
Why is the paper significant and/or influential?
Why did the researchers choose the approach that they did?
Is there anything counterintuitive or surprising in the paper?
Do you disagree with any of the assumptions or claims it makes?
Does the paper suggest any further research questions?

A related pitfall is to structure the journal as a sequence of disconnected entries.
Instead aim to \textbf{synthesise} multiple papers into a cohesive whole,
drawing connections between works by different authors.
Forming a holistic picture of a field is much more valuable than simply understanding individual works.

The wiki is primarily intended to become a useful shared resource for the cohort.
As such, students are expected to direct themselves and their peers in populating, structuring and editing the wiki.
If appropriate, you may copy and paste material from your individual journal into the wiki.
However note that a wiki is not a piece of academic writing
and thus will tend to have a less formal tone than you should be aiming for in your journal.
Edits may be required to ensure a consistent tone for the wiki.

You can, and indeed should, take inspiration from others' wiki contributions when working on your own journal.
However you \textbf{must not} copy verbatim material written by others;
doing so will be considered academic misconduct.

Most researchers write scientific papers for the intended audience of their fellow researchers.
Thus some papers can seem impenetrable to the novice reader.
Don't lose heart!
Discuss the paper with your peers.
Follow up the papers it cites to find alternative explanations.
If all else fails, continue reading the paper --- often a difficult paragraph is clarified by something which appears later.
