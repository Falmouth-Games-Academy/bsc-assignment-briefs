\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
``Because of the nature of Moore's law, anything that an extremely clever graphics programmer can do at one point can be replicated by a merely competent programmer some number of years later.''

    A demo of fluid simulation with NVIDIA's PhysX.
    Recent advances in GPU technology have enabled a wide range of high-fidelity real-time rendering and simulation effects.
}

In this assignment, you are required to \textbf{design} and \textbf{implement} a C++ program using SDL and OpenGL or a program where the components could be integrated into your group project.
This program should demonstrate the type of 3D computer graphics techniques that appear in a modern game engine.

Graphics technology is one of the most obvious areas in which innovation has driven gaming technology in recent years.
Modern gaming PCs and consoles contain powerful graphics processing units (GPUs),
and gamers expect modern games to push this hardware to its full potential.
In this assignment you will practice the use of advanced graphical effects.
Your final product will be a portfolio piece, which you can use in future to demonstrate your mastery of these techniques. This portfolio piece will be built up using a series of worksheets: worksheets 1 and 2 will give you a foundational framework for the rest of the assignment, which will be completed in worksheets 3 and 4. The requirements for the final artefact are detailed in the \textbf{Appendix} (Contract).

Finally you will have to create a video which captures your graphics demo.

This assignment is formed of \textbf{FOUR worksheets}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
	\item Project Framework
	\item Camera \& Basic Scene
	\item Demo specific work: planning and prototyping
	\item Demo specific work: optimisation and final implementation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup and Submission}

This assignment is a \textbf{programming} task. The base repository will be given in the first weeksheet; subsequent worksheets will build on the work done for previous ones.
It is therefore important that you keep up with the formative deadlines to make progress at a consistent pace.

This assignment consists of \textbf{four formative submissions}, followed by a \textbf{single summative submission}.
You will receive \textbf{feedback} after each formative submission.

At the end of the study block you will be required make a final summative submission of your artefact, comprising all four worksheet solutions.
Prepare a \textbf{single \texttt{.zip} file} containing:
\begin{itemize}
	\item your \textbf{artefact solution},
	\item a \textbf{link to your version control repository} (which must have the \textbf{appropriate permissions} set to allow your tutor(s) to view it), and
	\item a \textbf{short (3-5 minutes) video} demonstrating your final artefact (this may be a link to the video hosted on a suitable streaming service, e.g. Microsoft Stream)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Upload the .zip file to the appropriate submission area on LearningSpace}. 
This submission is for archival purposes only; your work will be marked and you will receive feedback in the viva, and you should \textbf{not} submit any new, unmarked work via LearningSpace unless you have been granted permission to do so by the tutor. You are, however, free (and encouraged) to update your work based on the formative feedback received at any time before the viva/summative deadline (whichever is sooner).

\paragraph{\todo[inline]{This final submission is subject to the usual university policies regarding late submission or non-submission,
as detailed in the course handbook ---
even if you have met all the formative deadlines for individual worksheets,
\textbf{failure to make a submission via LearningSpace by the summative deadline will be subject to penalties}.}}

\section*{Additional Guidance}

As always, avoid underestimating the effort required to implement even simple software; always consider scope.
From the proposal stage, you should consider very carefully what is feasible.

Your code will be assessed on \textbf{functional coherence}:
how well the finished product corresponds to the user stories,
and whether it has any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.

Unlike your previous assignments,
you will be assessed on the \textbf{performance} of your solution.
Real-time graphics and simulation are not just about creating aesthetically pleasing effects,
but doing so whilst maintaining a smooth and consistent framerate free of any lag or glitches that might frustrate the player.
It may be necessary to trade-off the complexity or fidelity of an effect
in order to achieve acceptable performance.

Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, libraries, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for complexity  
where something simpler would have sufficed.

\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve code comprehension,
and carefully choose the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
Use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation}.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
Consider allowing some literal values, where appropriate, to be ``tinkered'' without changing the source code,
e.g.\ by defining them in an external file read at startup.

As with all assignments on this course, you are expected to display a level of
\textbf{innovation and creative flair} befitting Falmouth University's reputation as a world-leading
arts institution.
One approach to promoting creativity is
\textbf{divergent thinking}: generating ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
Often the most interesting ideas are \textbf{subversive}: they deliberately go against
convention or obvious solutions.

You will \textbf{not} be judged on the quality of your art assets.
It is fine to use meshes and textures found online,
as long as they are available under an appropriate license and are properly attributed.
