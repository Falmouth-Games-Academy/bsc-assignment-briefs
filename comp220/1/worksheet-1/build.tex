\title{Worksheet 1: Project Framework}

\section*{Introduction}

In this worksheet you have to develop a Framework that can be used as basis to build a game or demo. This framework should use OpenGL, GLEW and SDL2.

You should complete this worksheet by building an application which implements the following:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Intialises} SDL
	\item \textbf{Creates} a Window which can be configured with different sizes, titles and can be toggled to full screen
	\item \textbf{Creates} an OpenGL Renderer
	\item \textbf{Initialises} GLEW
	\item \textbf{Runs} a Game Loop
	\item \textbf{Exits} when \textbf{escape} is pressed on the keyboard 
	\item \textbf{Cleans up} all resources when application exits
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Submission instructions}

Begin by \textbf{forking} the Bitbucket repository at the following URL:

\url{https://gamesgit.falmouth.ac.uk/projects/COMP220/repos/comp220-assignment-1}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories.
Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file and modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to include the defaults for \textbf{Visual Studio} or whichever IDE you are using, along with any editor-specific files and folders. 

You should complete a pull request before the hand-in on \textbf{Monday by 4pm on Week 4}. Feedback will be given in the pull request and in class.

\section*{Marking criteria}

Remember that \textbf{it is better to submit incomplete work than to submit nothing at all}. If you do not manage to finish all assigned tasks, then you can complete them before the submission of Worksheet 2

To demonstrate \textbf{adequate proficiency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Initialisation of SDL2
	\item Creation of a basic Window
	\item Cleanup after exit
\end{itemize} 

To demonstrate \textbf{competent proficiency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{adequate proficiency}
	\item Initialisation of OpenGL
	\item Initialisation of GLEW
\end{itemize}

To demonstrate \textbf{very good proficiency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{competent proficiency}
	\item Implement Game Loop
\end{itemize}

To demonstrate \textbf{excellent proficiency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{very good proficiency}
	\item Application exits when key is pressed
	\item Some evidence of software design
	\item Some evidence of reusability (functions, classes, inheritance) 
\end{itemize}

To demonstrate \textbf{outstanding proficiency}, complete the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Achieve \textbf{excellent proficiency}
	\item Evidence of good software design (unit tests, static code analysis)
	\item Evidence of reusability (Framework is compiled into a library and can be reused)
\end{itemize}
