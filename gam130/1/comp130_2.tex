\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you will prepare a playable early-access game. Your game will be written in \textit{C++} and \textit{Blueprints} using \textit{Unreal Engine 4}. You will work collaboratively in a multi-disciplinary team with other BA and BSc students.

The success of a digital game is not just determined by the fun of its design, but also by the soundness of its architecture. Put simply, games with serious bugs do not sell. As such, the value of software engineering principles cannot be emphasised enough! Reflecting upon these principles, using the lens of a development process that mirrors industry practice is therefore critically important. Further to this, there are key quality assurance techniques and anlysis methods to appy. This will be an ongoing process, so engagement will need to persist throughout the production cycle.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Launch}, as a \textbf{group}, a GitHub Pages website \textbf{and} promotional video, which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describes} the game concept \textbf{and} instructions on how to play;
    		\item as well as \textbf{showcase} the game's unique selling points and aesthetic.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as an \textbf{individual}, a draft A3 research-style poster which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    	    	\item \textbf{identify ONE} component for which \textbf{you} are individually accountable;
    		\item and \textbf{describe} its specification \textbf{and} design using UML.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, a playable game prototype which:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{acts} as a stand-alone executable suitable for play-testing;
    		\item and \textbf{illustrates} the core game mechanic.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write}, as an \textbf{individual}, a blog post for the GitHub Pages site which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{introduce} yourself \textbf{and} the area of the game you are working on;
		\item \textbf{describe} the architecture and engineering of the game;
    		\item \textbf{analyse} the engineering quality of the game \textbf{and your} component.
	\end{enumerate}	
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, an early-access release canditate which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as an \textbf{individual}, a final A3 research-style poster that:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{analyses} the architectural and engineering qualities of the early-access release canditate;
    		\item and \textbf{describes} the component \textbf{you} implemented using pseudocode, code snippets, UML, \textbf{and} software quality metrics. 
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, a \textbf{group} `tech demo' with, \textbf{individually}, your poster, which:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarifies} the technical content of \textbf{EACH} poster;
    		\item and \textbf{showcases} the early-access release canditate of the game.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
  
\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{product development task}. For this project you \textbf{MUST} use the \texttt{SVN} repository allocated to your team by GA technicians for version control.

Use a sensible directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories and trunks/branches. Add and maintain a \texttt{readme.md} file. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item The GitHub Pages site is live;
	\item Instructions are adequete to enable an external assessor to play;
	\item The unique selling points are clearly listed;
	\item The aesthetic is illustrated with at least four screenshots;
	\item The core game mechanics are showcased through a video.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, setup GitHub Pages and populate a single \texttt{HTML} page with promotional material about the game. Show it to your product owner prior to the March `Show and Tell' event. Leverage the material the BA students are prearing for the event and mirror these, within reason, on the website.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{product owner}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of a \textbf{single formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item An appropriate game component is adequetely described;
	\item and a UML class diagram is used to describe the design.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a draft version of the poster. Submit the poster, in \texttt{.pdf} format, to the review activity in LearningSpace ahead of the workshop session in Week 5.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{module tutor}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is formed of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item A working build is demonstrated at \textbf{EACH} sprint review;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct meaningful reviews.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, build a stand-alone executable from the master branch ahead of \textbf{EACH} sprint review meeting. It is standard practice to maintain an archive of working builds in case of emergency. Ensure assets are merged in regularly. Showcase the executable at \textbf{EACH} sprint review meeting.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{product owner}.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D consists of a \textbf{single formative} submission. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.  The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item The constribution is communicated in a clear and concise manner;
	\item The contribution is meaningful and will, or will potentially, add value.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part D, reflect on how your invididual contributions are adding value. Focus on \textbf{one} key contribution. Gather your thoughts into a short blog post to your GitHub pages site (from Part A). Illustrate the engineering aspects using appropriate diagrams and data analyses. Upload a link to your blog post to the review activity on LearningSpace ahead of the session in Week 9. 

You will receive \textbf{informal feedback} in the session from the \textbf{module tutor}.

\subsection*{Part E}

Part E is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part E, revise the prototype based on the feedback that you have received. Build the project and copy it to a USB storage device. Please note, you \textbf{MUST} include \textbf{both} the source code \textbf{and} a stand-alone playable build. These should be in two separate and clearly labelled folders. Instructions on how to play the game \textbf{MUST} also be included. Then, submit it physically alongside your colleagues on the other courses.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\subsection*{Part F}

Part F is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of the brief for details on the criteria.

To complete Part F, finish the poster (from Part B) using any software of your choice. Upload the relevant files to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\subsection*{Part G}

Part G is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item A working \textbf{and} playable early-access release canditate is showcased;
	\item Analyses of engineering quality are sufficient \textbf{and} somewhat accurate.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part G, prepare for the `tech demo'. Ensure you are comfortable discussing both the game and the technical content of your poster. Then, attend the scheduled session. Print your poster ahead of time and bring it with you. This is your own responsibility! It should be A3 paper and portrait. Please, also ensure that someone is available to setup ahead of the session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from \textbf{attending staff}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

This is a complex and challenging project. Accordingly, it is double-weighted in terms of academic credit. This project alone is worth the same as an entire module of study. Invest a substantial proportion of your time into it: about one third! There are \textbf{FOUR} main deliverables. These are:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item A website about your game project, which you prepare collectively as a group on GitHub and show to your product owner;
	\item A blog post, in which review you---as an individual---review your key contribution(s) to the group project and show to your module tutor;
	\item A working and playable version of the early-acces release canditate, submitted physically as a group on a USB device, by the production task deadline;
	\item and, a poster highlighting \textbf{ONE} game component that you implemented, submitted online as an invidual to the LearningSpace, by the production task deadline.
\end{enumerate}

Carefully select the algorithms and/or components that you take ownership of and implement. These will not only need to interface with other game components, but also other kinds of contributions made by artistic colleagues. Aim for high cohesion and low coupling! Firmly specify the requirements and ensure they are not too broad. This will help you to avoid overlap with the work of your peers and overburdening yourself with too much work. 

Commit and to push your source code and related assets to the repository frequently. This will make it easier for you to maintain a backup of your work. It will also help you to assess your productivity. Version control \textbf{MUST} become a core and essential part of your workflow. 

Poor planning and poor time management can have a substantial impact on this assignment. Programming is quite unlike many of the other subjects you may have studied. It cannot be ``crammed'' into a last minute deluge. Sustain a steady pace across the duration of the course. Do a little programming every day---from the start!

For the most part, this is a group effort and will be marked accordingly.
However, we want to avoid the situation where students try to ``coast'' through the assignment,
and equally the situation where one member of the group takes the lion's share of the work
and prevents the others from contributing effectively.
Marks will be weighted by a multipliers for \textbf{individual contribution}, which penalises both of these behaviours.
Any student who has contributed their \textit{fair share} of effort to the project will receive a fair \% for their effort,
so any student who is putting in the appropriate level of effort has no need to worry. Note that effort is not the same as productivity.

\todo[inline]{\textbf{Note:} In addition to sprint retrospectives, peer-review activities, and your repository, your product owners will track your individual contributions---alongside other deliverables, as described above. Engage with your PO if you are encountering difficulty! They are your mentors and lifeline. }

You are expected to act professionally. This is a university environment, not school. Among many notable differences, it is left to you to arrange daily stand-up meetings and it is mandatory for every member of the team to engage with agile practices. Agile should be maintained every weekday throughout the duration of the project, including the studio period and days when you have sessions. 

It is also \textbf{mandatory} to attend every single meeting with your product owner. Your attendence to these meetings will be monitored. If you cannot attend a meeting, you \textbf{MUST} send a email in advance to your product owner. This should detail your apologies just as if you were emailing a senior colleague or manager in a real business context. You will be penalised on your individual contribution multiplier for any unauthorised absences. 

Now that you are working in larger, multi-disciplinary teams, you will encounter collaborative complexity. There will be many more lines of communication, and therefore greater opportunity for disorganisation and conflict. Likewise, some members of the team may become agitated if others appear to be less productive than they should be. Whatever forms that these may take, it is important that you recognise such challenges and approach them in a collegiate and constructive manner. It is \textit{critically important} that you maintain your professionalism. Be helpful and understanding. Your criticisms should be a gift to help your peers grow, improve, and mature. This means that concerns should relate to directly to working practice (or lack thereof) and be reasonably actionable. When raised, the discussion should be fair and tolerate the possibility of a compromise, as well as the your potential involvement in providing direct support for your peer.    

Do not permit conflicts to fester and stagnate. Tackle these head-on at the earliest opportunity. However, if there is a breach of professional conduct, contact your product owner.
