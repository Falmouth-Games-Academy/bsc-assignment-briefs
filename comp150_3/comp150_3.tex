\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you critically reflect on your teamwork and team dynamic across the group project, using this as a lens to review you own team-working skills. You will also develop a plan of action to overcome any challenges; thereby, improving the quality of your output in future group projects.

Such reflection and planning is an extremely important part of learning games development. Research shows that deliberate practice is very effective at nurturing expertise in software engineering. Everyone properly adopting this technique eventually succeeds, despite the challenging nature of the subject.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a weekly team blog, authored \textbf{collaboratively}, that must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describe} the progress of the team project;
    		\item \textbf{assess} any obstacles or challenges that the team has encountered;
    		\item and \textbf{outline} specific actions to take to overcome them.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft 500-word report that must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{identify two} key teamwork skills that you consider weaknesses;
    		\item \textbf{assess} your application of \textbf{each} of these skills, \textbf{describing how} they affected your work \textbf{and suggesting why} they arose;
    		\item and then \textbf{identify how} to improve \textbf{each} of these skills, with reference to SMART actions.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a final 500-word report that must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{reflective writing task} and so regular reflection is expected. Use the existing \texttt{comp150-game} repository for your weekly blog. Also, fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp110-evaluation}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. The \texttt{readme.md} file is not needed. 

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{TeX}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Progress is described with adequate detail;
	\item Challenges are clearly explained;
	\item Both team-related and technical challenges are addressed;
	\item All reports afford appropriate anonymity;
	\item Reflections are constructive rather than blaming and/or punitive;
	\item Proposed actions to overcome challenges are SMART.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, one member of the team should write a brief report each term-time week in the \texttt{readme.md} document hosted in the existing \texttt{comp150-game} repository. Separate each week with a heading. It is recommended that the team discuss the content of the report together and that the scribe be changed each week.  Ensure that the report is pushed to GitHub prior to each scheduled sprint review session. Then, attend the scheduled code review session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a draft version of the report. Use the marking rubric to inform the structure of the document. Ensure that the TeX source and compiled \texttt{*.pdf} are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled review session. Then, attend the scheduled review session.

You will receive \textbf{peer feedback} within 3 working days after the code review session.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. The following criteria are used to allocate marks:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Appropriateness and Specificity of Selection of Key Teamwork Skills;
	\item Adequacy of Self-Appraisal in Relation to Key Teamwork Skills;
	\item Depth of Reflection on Key Teamwork Skills;
	\item Appropriateness of Plan for the Future;
	\item Quality of Academic Writing.
\end{enumerate}

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

This is a reflective writing task, and as such you are expected to write in a reflective style. Make use of first-person plural and follow a similar style. However, take care to assume an as objective position as possible. There must be sufficient analysis and reference to evidence in order to support your claims. More so than would be expected in a personal reflective report.

Teamwork analysis is \textbf{not} the place where you indulge in witch-hunts and blame-games. While it is inevitable that incidents occur, this is not an excuse to blame other students for shortcomings in a project. This is not only poor form, but is indicative of the report's author themself having poor teamworking skills. Incidents should be taken as an opportunity for reflection. Why wasn't a contingency in place? Why had nobody pair programmed a critical user story? Why wasn't there a backup? Where was the collective responsibility? These are opportunities for growth and personal development.

A common concern is lack of engagement by other members of the team. Such concerns can be discussed, but must be anonymous. No other student should be identified in either the report or the blog. Moreover, concerns must be sufficiently analysed. For example, why was the design of the game not re-scoped if it became clear that one of the specialists on the team was unlikely to deliver key components upon which a proposed design relied?

The continuous cycle of reflection and planning is the cornerstone of deliberate practice. It is extremely important to help you learn. Avoid treating this activity as an afterthought. Further to this, avoid delegating the blog a single member of the team. It should represent the output from a team discussion that occurs at the end of each week. 

Furthermore, do not pay too much attention on the end-product (i.e., the game itself). A short description alongside some screenshots and pseudocode is more than sufficient. It is the reflection and analysis that is important. Namely, \textit{how} and \textit{why} your team's working practice is influencing the quality of the game in more abstract terms. As such, presenting your work in terms of `lessons learned' can be appropriate. This will likely lead to higher quality submissions in the future and such lessons could form some of the components of your final report. Critically, however, lessons learned form a strong foundation for improving your teamwork.

As with previous evaluations, the most common mistake when planning future actions to take is being too general. It is, therefore, important to consider SMART goals: specific; measurable; achievable; relevant; and time-bound. Teamwork is critically important in the games industry, whether this be through an out-sourcing, remote collaboration, or indeed pair-programming. So, do ensure that you engage with this process of reflection and planning to improve your teamworking skills.
